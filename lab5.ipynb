              "' foreword              lolita, or the confession of a white widowed male, such were the two titles under which the writer of the present note received the strange pages it preambulates. humbert humbert, their author, had died in legal captivity, of coronary thrombosis, on november , , a few days before his trial was scheduled to start. his lawyer, my good friend and relation, clarence choate clark, esq., now of he district of columbia bar, in asking me to edit the manuscript, based his request on a clause in his clients will which empowered my eminent cousin to use the discretion in all matters pertaining to the preparation of lolita for print. mr. clarks decision may have been influenced by the fact that the editor of his choice had just been awarded the poling prize for a modest work do the senses make sense wherein certain morbid states and perversions had been discussed.       my task proved simpler than either of us had anticipated. save for the correction of obvious solecisms and a careful suppression of a few tenacious details that despite h.h.s own efforts still subsisted in his text as signposts and tombstones indicative of places or persons that taste would conceal and compassion spare, this remarkable memoir is presented intact. its authors bizarre cognomen is his own invention and, of course, this maskthrough which two hypnotic eyes seem to glowhad to remain unlifted in accordance with its wearers wish. while haze only rhymes with the heroines real surname, her first name is too closely interwound with the inmost fiber of the book to allow one to alter it nor as the reader will perceive for himself is there any practical necessity to do so. references to h.h.s crime may be looked up by the inquisitive in the daily papers for septemberoctober  its cause and purpose would have continued to come under my reading lamp.       for the benefit of oldfashioned readers who wish to follow the destinies of the real people beyond the true story, a few details may be given as received from mr. windmuller, or ramsdale, who desires his identity suppressed so that the long shadow of this sorry and sordid business should not reach the community to which he is proud to belong. his daughter, louise, is by now a college sophomore, mona dahl is a student in paris. rita has recently married the proprietor of a hotel in florida. mrs. richard f. schiller died in childbed, giving birth to a stillborn girl, on christmas day , in gray star, a settlemen in the remotest northwest. vivian darkbloom has written a biography, my cue, to be publshed shortly, and critics who have perused the manuscript call it her best book. the caretakers of the various cemeteries involved report that no ghosts walk.       viewed simply as a novel, lolita deals with situations and emotions that would remain exasperatingly vague to the reader had their expression been etiolated by means of platitudinous evasions. true, not a single obscene term is to be found in the whole work indeed, the robust philistine who is conditioned by modern conventions into accepting without qualms a lavish array of fourletter words in a banal novel, will be quite shocked by their absence here. if, however, for this paradoxical prudes comfort, an editor attempted to dilute or omit scenes that a certain type of mind might call aphrodisiac see in this respect the monumental decision rendered december , , by hon. john m. woolsey in regard to another, considerably more outspoken, book, one would have to forego the publication of lolita altogether, since those very scenes that one might inpetly accuse of sensuous existence of their own, are the most strictly functional ones in the development of a tragic tale tending unswerivingly to nothing less than a moral apotheosis. the cynic may say that commercial pornography makes the same claim the learned may counter by asserting that h.h.s impassioned confession is a tempest in a test tube that at least  of american adult malesa conservative estimate according to dr. blanche schwarzmann verbal communicationenjoy yearly, in one way or another, the special experience h.h. describes with such despare that had our demented diarist gone, in the fatal summer of , to a competent psychopathologist, there would have been no disaster but then, neither would there have been this book.       this commentator may be excused for repeating what he has stressed in his own books and lectures, namely that offensive is frequently but a synonym for unusual and a great work of art is of course always original, and thus by its very nature should come as a more or less shocking surprise. i have no intention to glorify h.h. no doubt, he is horrible, is is abject, he is a shining example of moral leprosy, a mixture of ferocity and jocularity that betrays supreme misery perhaps, but is not conducive to attractiveness. he is ponderously capricious. many of his casual opinions on the people and scenery of this country are ludicrous. a desperate honesty that throbs through his confession does not absolve him from sins of diabolical cunning. he is abnormal. he is not a gentleman. but how magically his singing violin can conjure up a tendresse, a compassion for lolita that makes us entranced with the book while abhorring its author       as a case history, lolita will become, no doubt, a classic in psychiatric circles. as a work of art, it transcends its expiatory aspects and still more important to us than scientific significance and literary worth, is the ethical impact the book should have on the serious reader for in this poignant personal study there lurks a general lesson the wayward child, the egotistic mother, the panting maniacthese are not only vivid characters in a unique story they warn us of dangerous trends they point out potent evils. lolita should make all of usparents, social workers, educatorsapply ourselves with still greater vigilance and vision to the task of bringing up a better generation in a safer world.                john ray, jr., ph.d.                       widworth, mass                     part one                                             lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. my sin, my soul. loleeta the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. lo. lee. ta.         she was lo, plain lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. she was lola in slacks. she was dolly at school. she was dolores on the dotted line. but in my arms she was always lolita.         did she have a precursor she did, indeed she did. in point of fact, there might have been no lolita at all had i not loved, one summer, a certain initial girlchild. in a princedom by the sea. oh when about as many years before lolita was born as my age was that summer. you can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.         ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noblewinged seraphs, envied. look at this tangle of thorns.                                             i was born in , in paris. my father was a gentle, easygoing person, a salad of racial genes a swiss citizen, of mixed french and austrian descent, with a dash of the danube in his veins. i am going to pass around in a minute some lovely, glossyblue picturepostcards. he owned a luxurious hotel on the riviera. his father and two grandfathers had sold wine, jewels and silk, respectively. at thirty he married an english girl, daughter of jerome dunn, the alpinist, and granddaughter of two dorset parsons, experts in obscure subjectspaleopedology and aeolian harps, respectively. my very photogenic mother died in a freak accident picnic, lightning when i was three, and, save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest past, nothing of her subsists within the hollows and dells of memory, over which, if you can still stand my style i am writing under observation, the sun of my infancy had set surely, you all know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with the midges, about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by the rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer dusk a furry warmth, golden midges.         my mothers elder sister, sybil, whom a cousin of my fathers had married and then neglected, served in my immediate family as a kind of unpaid governess and housekeeper. somebody told me later that she had been in love with my father, and that he had lightheartedly taken advantage of it one rainy day and forgotten it by the time the weather cleared. i was extremely fond of her, despite the rigiditythe fatal rigidityof some of her rules. perhaps she wanted to make of me, in the fullness of time, a better widower than my father. aunt sybil had pinkrimmed azure eyes and a waxen complexion. she wrote poetry. she was poetically superstitious. she said she knew she would die soon after my sixteenth birthday, and did. her husband, a great traveler in perfumes, spent most of his time in america, where eventually he founded a firm and acquired a bit of real estate.         i grew, a happy, healthy child in a bright would of illustrated books, clean sand, orange trees, friendly dogs, sea vistas and smiling faces. around me the splendid hotel mirana revolved as a kind of private universe, a whitewashed cosmos within the blue greater one that blazed outside. from the aproned potscrubber to the flanneled potentate, everybody liked me, everybody petted me. elderly american ladies leaning on their canes listed towards me like towers of pisa. ruined russian princesses who could not pay my father, bought me expensive bonbons. he,          mon cher petit papa, took me out boating and biking, taught me to swim and dive and waterski, read to me          don quixoteand          les miserables, and i adored and respected him and felt glad for him whenever i overheard the servants discuss his various ladyfriends, beautiful and kind beings who made much of me and cooed and shed precious tears over my cheerful motherlessness.         i attended an english day school a few miles from home, and there i played rackets and fives, and got excellent marks, and was on perfect terms with schoolmates and teachers alike. the only definite sexual events that i can remember as having occurred before my thirteenth birthday that is, before i first saw my little annabel were a solemn, decorous and purely theoretical talk about pubertal surprises in the rose garden of the school with an american kid, the son of a then celebrated motionpicture actress whom he seldom saw in the threedimensional world and some interesting reactions on the part of my organism to certain photographs, pearl and umbra, with infinitely soft partings, in pichons sumptuous          le beaute humainethat that i had filched from under a mountain of marblebound          graphicsin the hotel library. later, in his delightful debonair manner, my father gave me all the information he thought i needed about sex this was just before sending me, in the autumn of , to a          lycein lyon where we were to spend three winters but alas, in the summer of that year, he was touring italy with mme de r. and her daughter, and i had nobody to complain to, nobody to consult.                                             annabel was, like the writer, of mixed parentage halfenglish, halfdutch, in her case. i remember her features far less distinctly today than i did a few years ago, before i knew lolita. there are two kinds of visual memory one when you skillfully recreate an image in the laboratory of your mind, with your eyes open and then i see annabel in such general terms as honeycolored skin, think arms, brown bobbed hair, long lashes, big bright mouth and the other when you instantly evoke, with shut eyes, on the dark inner side of your eyelids, the objective, absolutely optical replica of a beloved face, a little ghost in natural colors and this is how i see lolita.         let me therefore primly limit myself, in describing annabel, to saying she was a lovely child a few months my junior. her parents were old friends of my aunts, and as stuffy as she. they had rented a villa not far from hotel mirana. bald brown mr. leigh and fat, powdered mrs. leigh born vanessa van ness. how i loathed them at first, annabel and i talked of peripheral affairs. she kept lifting handfuls of fine sand and letting it pour through her fingers. our brains were turned the way those of intelligent european preadolescents were in our day and set, and i doubt if much individual genius should be assigned to our interest in the plurality of inhabited worlds, competitive tennis, infinity, solipsism and so on. the softness and fragility of baby animals caused us the same intense pain. she wanted to be a nurse in some famished asiatic country i wanted to be a famous spy.         all at once we were madly, clumsily, shamelessly, agonizingly in love with each other hopelessly, i should add, because that frenzy of mutual possession might have been assuaged only by our actually imbibing and assimilating every particle of each others soul and flesh but there we were, unable even to mate as slum children would have so easily found an opportunity to do. after one wild attempt we made to meet at night in her garden of which more later, the only privacy we were allowed was to be out of earshot but not out of sight on the populous part of the          plage. there, on the soft sand, a few feet away from our elders, we would sprawl all morning, in a petrified paroxysm of desire, and take advantage of every blessed quirk in space and time to touch each other her hand, halfhidden in the sand, would creep toward me, its slender brown fingers sleepwalking nearer and nearer then, her opalescent knee would start on a long cautious journey sometimes a chance rampart built by younger children granted us sufficient concealment to graze each others salty lips these incomplete contacts drove our healthy and inexperienced young bodies to such a state of exasperation that not even the cold blue water, under which we still clawed at each other, could bring relief.         among some treasures i lost during the wanderings of my adult years, there was a snapshot taken by my aunt which showed annabel, her parents and the staid, elderly, lame gentleman, a dr. cooper, who that same summer courted my aunt, grouped around a table in a sidewalk cafe. annabel did not come out well, caught as she was in the act of bending over her          chocolat glace, and her thin bare shoulders and the parting in her hair were about all that could be identified as i remember that picture amid the sunny blur into which her lost loveliness graded but i, sitting somewhat apart from the rest, came out with a kind of dramatic conspicuousness a moody, beetlebrowed boy in a dark sport shirt and welltailored white shorts, his legs crossed, sitting in profile, looking away. that photograph was taken on the last day of our fatal summer and just a few minutes before we made our second and final attempt to thwart fate. under the flimsiest of pretexts this was our very last chance, and nothing really mattered we escaped from the cafe to the beach, and found a desolate stretch of sand, and there, in the violet shadow of some red rocks forming a kind of cave, had a brief session of avid caresses, with somebodys lost pair of sunglasses for only witness. i was on my knees, and on the point of possessing my darling, when two bearded bathers, the old man of the sea and his brother, came out of the sea with exclamations of ribald encouragement, and four months later she died of typhus in corfu.                                             i leaf again and again through these miserable memories, and keep asking myself, was it then, in the glitter of that remote summer, that the rift in my life began or was my excessive desire for that child only the first evidence of an inherent singularity when i try to analyze my own cravings, motives, actions and so forth, i surrender to a sort of retrospective imagination which feeds the analytic faculty with boundless alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork and refork without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past. i am convinced, however, that in a certain magic and fateful way lolita began with annabel.         i also know that the shock of annabels death consolidated the frustration of that nightmare summer, made of it a permanent obstacle to any further romance throughout the cold years of my youth. the spiritual and the physical had been blended in us with a perfection that must remain incomprehensible to the matteroffact, crude, standardbrained youngsters of today. long after her death i felt her thoughts floating through mine. long before we met we had had the same dreams. we compared notes. we found strange affinities. the same june of the same year  a stray canary had fluttered into her house and mine, in two widely separated countries. oh, lolita, had          youloved me thus         i have reserved for the conclusion of my annabel phase the account of our unsuccessful first tryst. one night, she managed to deceive the vicious vigilance of her family. in a nervous and slenderleaved mimosa grove at the back of their villa we found a perch on the ruins of a low stone wall. through the darkness and the tender trees we could see the arabesques of lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of sensitive memory, appear to me now like playing cardspresumably because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy. she trembled and twitched as i kissed the corner of her parted lips and the hot lobe of her ear. a cluster of stars palely glowed above us, between the silhouettes of long thin leaves that vibrant sky seemed as naked as she was under her light frock. i saw her face in the sky, strangely distinct, as if it emitted a faint radiance of its own. her legs, her lovely live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand located what it sought, a dreamy and eerie expression, halfpleasure, halfpain, came over those childish features. she sat a little higher than i, and whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to kiss me, her head would bend with a sleepy, soft, drooping movement that was almost woeful, and her bare knees caught and compressed my wrist, and slackened again and her quivering mouth, distorted by the acridity of some mysterious potion, with a sibilant intake of breath came near to my face. she would try to relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips against mine then my darling would draw away with a nervous toss of her hair, and then again come darkly near and let me feed on her open mouth, while with a generosity that was ready to offer her everything, my heart, my throat, my entrails, i have her to hold in her awkward fist the scepter of my passion.         i recall the scent of some kind of toilet powderi believe she stole it from her mothers spanish maida sweetish, lowly, musky perfume. it mingled with her own biscuity odor, and my senses were suddenly filled to the brim a sudden commotion in a nearby bush prevented them from overflowingand as we drew away from each other, and with aching veins attended to what was probably a prowling cat, there came from the house her mothers voice calling her, with a rising frantic noteand dr. cooper ponderously limped out into the garden. but that mimosa grovethe haze of stars, the tingle, the flame, the honeydew, and the ache remained with me, and that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted me ever sinceuntil at last, twentyfour years later, i broke her spell by incarnating her in another.                                             the days of my youth, as i look back on them, seem to fly away from me in a flurry of pale repetitive scraps like those morning snow storms of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the observation car. in my sanitary relations with women i was practical, ironical and brisk. while a college student, in london and paris, paid ladies sufficed me. my studies were meticulous and intense, although not particularly fruitful. at first, i planned to take a degree in psychiatry and many          manqutalents do but i was even more          manquthan that a peculiar exhaustion, i am so oppressed, doctor, set in and i switched to english literature, where so many frustrated poets end as pipesmoking teachers in tweeds. paris suited me. i discussed soviet movies with expatriates. i sat with uranists in the deux magots. i published tortuous essays in obscure journals. i composed pastiches                                 frulen von kulp             may turn, her hand upon the door             i will not follow her. nor fresca. nor             that gull.                             a paper of mine entitled the proustian theme in a letter from keats to benjamin bailey was chuckled over by the six or seven scholars who read it. i launched upon an           histoire abregee de la poesie anglaise for a prominent publishing firm, and then started to compile that manual of french literature for englishspeaking students with comparisons drawn from english writers which was to occupy me throughout the fortiesand the last volume of which was almost ready for press by the time of my arrest.         i found a jobteaching english to a group of adults in auteuil. then a school for boys employed me for a couple of winters. now and then i took advantage of the acquaintances i had formed among social workers and psychotherapists to visit in their company various institutions, such as orphanages and reform schools, where pale pubescent girls with matted eyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of that granted one in dreams.         now i wish to introduce the following idea. between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than they, reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic that is, demoniac and these chosen creatures i propose to designate as nymphets.         it will be marked that i substitute time terms for spatial ones. in fact, i would have the reader see nine and fourteen as the boundariesthe mirrory beaches and rosy rocksof an enchanted island haunted by those nymphets of mine and surrounded by a vast, misty sea. between those age limits, are all girlchildren nymphets of course not. otherwise, we who are in the know, we lone voyagers, we nympholepts, would have long gone insane. neither are good looks any criterion and vulgarity, or at least what a given community terms so, does not necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace, the elusive, shifty, soulshattering, insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where lolita plays with her likes. within the same age limits the number of true nymphets is trickingly inferior to that of provisionally plain, or just nice, or cute, or even sweet and attractive, ordinary, plumpish, formless, coldskinned, essentially human little girls, with tummies and pigtails, who may or may not turn into adults of great beauty look at the ugly dumplings in black stockings and white hats that are metamorphosed into stunning stars of the screen. a normal man given a group photograph of school girls or girl scouts and asked to point out the comeliest one will not necessarily choose the nymphet among them. you have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite melancholy, with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a supervoluptuous flame permanently aglow in your subtle spine oh, how you have to cringe and hide, in order to discern at once, by ineffable signsthe slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the slenderness of a downy limb, and other indices which despair and shame and tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulatethe little deadly demon among the wholesome children          shestands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic power.         furthermore, since the idea of time plays such a magic part in the matter, the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be a gap of several years, never less than ten i should say, generally thirty or forty, and as many as ninety in a few known cases, between maiden and man to enable the latter to come under a nymphets spell. it is a question of focal adjustment, of a certain distance that the inner eye thrills to surmount, and a certain contrast that the mind perceives with a gasp of perverse delight. when i was a child and she was a child, my little annabel was no nymphet to me i was her equal, a faunlet in my own right, on that same enchanted island of time but today, in september , after twentynine years have elapsed, i think i can distinguish in her the initial fateful elf in my life. we loved each other with a premature love, marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives. i was a strong lad and survived but the poison was in the wound, and the wound remained ever open, and soon i found myself maturing amid a civilization which allows a man of twentyfive to court a girl of sixteen but not a girl of twelve.         no wonder, then, that my adult life during the european period of my existence proved monstrously twofold. overtly, i had socalled normal relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins or pears for breasts inly, i was consumed by a hell furnace of localized lust for every passing nymphet whom as a lawabiding poltroon i never dared approach. the human females i was allowed to wield were but palliative agents. i am ready to believe that the sensations i derived from natural fornication were much the same as those known to normal big males consorting with their normal big mates in that routine rhythm which shakes the world. the trouble was that those gentlemen had not, and i          had, caught glimpses of an incomparably more poignant bliss. the dimmest of my pollutive dreams was a thousand times more dazzling than all the adultery the most virile writer of genius or the most talented impotent might imagine. my world was split. i was aware of not one but two sexes, neither of which was mine both would be termed female by the anatomist. but to me, through the prism of my senses, they were as different as mist and mast. all this i rationalize now. in my twenties and early thirties, i did not understand my throes quite so clearly. while my body knew what it craved for, my mind rejected my bodys every plea. one moment i was ashamed and frightened, another recklessly optimistic. taboos strangulated me. psychoanalysts wooed me with pseudoliberations of pseudolibidoes. the fact that to me the only object of amorous tremor were sisters of annabels, her handmaids and girlpages, appeared to me at times as a forerunner of insanity. at other times i would tell myself that it was all a question of attitude, that there was really nothing wrong in being moved to distraction by girlchildren. let me remind my reader that in england, with the passage of the children and young person act in , the term girlchild is defined as a girl who is over eight but under fourteen years after that, from fourteen to seventeen, the statutory definition is young person. in massachusetts, u.s., on the other hand, a wayward child is, technically, one between seven and seventeen years of age who, moreover, habitually associates with vicious or immoral persons. hugh broughton, a writer of controversy in the reign of james the first, has proved that rahab was a harlot at ten years of age. this is all very interesting, and i daresay you see me already frothing at the mouth in a fit but no, i am not i am just winking happy thoughts into a little tiddle cup. here are some more pictures. here is virgil who could the nymphet sing in a single tone, but probably preferred a lads perineum. here are two of king akhnatens and queen nefertitis prenubile nile daughters that royal couple had a litter of six, wearing nothing but many necklaces of bright beads, relaxed on cushions, intact after three thousand years, with their soft brown puppybodies, cropped hair and long ebony eyes. here are some brides of ten compelled to seat themselves on the fascinum, the virile ivory in the temples of classical scholarship. marriage and cohabitation before the age of puberty are still not uncommon in certain east indian provinces. lepcha old men of eighty copulate with girls of eight, and nobody minds. after all, dante fell madly in love with beatrice when she was nine, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely, and bejeweled, in a crimson frock, and this was in , in florence, at a private feast in the merry month of may. and when petrarch fell madly in love with his laureen, she was a fairhaired nymphet of twelve running in the wind, in the pollen and dust, a flower in flight, in the beautiful plain as descried from the hills of vaucluse.         but let us be prim and civilized. humbert humbert tried hard to be good. really and truly, he id. he had the utmost respect for ordinary children, with their purity and vulnerability, and under no circumstances would he have interfered with the innocence of a child, if there was the least risk of a row. but how his heart beat when, among the innocent throng, he espied a demon child,           enfant charmante et fourbe, dim eyes, bright lips, ten years in jail if you only show her you are looking at her. so life went. humbert was perfectly capable of intercourse with eve, but it was lilith he longed for. the budstage of breast development appears early . years in the sequence of somatic changes accompanying pubescence. and the next maturational item available is the first appearance of pigmented pubic hair . years. my little cup brims with tiddles.         a shipwreck. an atoll. alone with a drowned passengers shivering child. darling, this is only a game how marvelous were my fancied adventures as i sat on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a trembling book. around the quiet scholar, nymphets played freely, as if he were a familiar statue or part of an old trees shadow and sheen. once a perfect little beauty in a tartan frock, with a clatter put her heavily armed foot near me upon the bench to dip her slim bare arms into me and righten the strap of her roller skate, and i dissolved in the sun, with my book for fig leaf, as her auburn ringlets fell all over her skinned knee, and the shadow of leaves i shared pulsated and melted on her radiant limb next to my chameloenic cheek. another time a redhaired school girl hung over me in the          metro, and a revelation of axillary russet i obtained remained in my blood for weeks. i could list a great number of these onesided diminutive romances. some of them ended in a rich flavor of hell. it happened for instance that from my balcony i would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like a nymphet in the act of undressing before a cooperative mirror. thus isolated, thus removed, the vision acquired an especially keen charm that made me race with all speed toward my lone gratification. but abruptly, fiendishly, the tender pattern of nudity i had adored would be transformed into the disgusting lamplit bare arm of a man in his underclothes reading his paper by the open window in the hot, damp, hopeless summer night.         ropeskipping, hopscotch. that old woman in black who sat down next to me on my bench, on my rack of joy a nymphet was groping under me for a lost marble, and asked if i had stomachache, the insolent hag. ah, leave me alone in my pubescent park, in my mossy garden. let them play around me forever. never grow up.                                             a propos i have often wondered what became of those nymphets later in this wroughtiron would of crisscross cause and effect, could it be that the hidden throb i stole from them did not affect          theirfuture i had possessed herand she never knew it. all right. but would it not tell sometime later had i not somehow tampered with her fate by involving her image in my voluptas oh, it was, and remains, a source of great and terrible wonder.         i learned, however, what they looked like, those lovely, maddening, thinarmed nymphets, when they grew up. i remember walking along an animated street on a gray spring afternoon somewhere near the madeleine. a short slim girl passed me at a rapid, highheeled, tripping step, we glanced back at the same moment, she stopped and i accosted her. she came hardly up to my chest hair and had the kind of dimpled round little face french girls so often have, and i liked her long lashes and tightfitting tailored dress sheathing in pearlgray her young body which still retainedand that was the nymphic echo, the chill of delight, the leap in my loinsa childish something mingling with the professional          fretillementof her small agile rump. i asked her price, and she promptly replied with melodious silvery precision a bird, a very bird           cent. i tried to haggle but she saw the awful lone longing in my lowered eyes, directed so far down at her round forehead and rudimentary hat a band, a posy and with one beat of her lashes           tant pis, she said, and made as if to move away. perhaps only three years earlier i might have seen her coming home from school that evocation settled the matter. she led me up the usual steep stairs, with the usual bell clearing the way for the          monsieurwho might not care to meet another          monsieur, on the mournful climb to the abject room, all bed and          bidet. as usual, she asked at once for her petit          cadeau, and as usual i asked her name monique and her age eighteen. i was pretty well acquainted with the banal way of streetwalkers. they all answer           dixhuita trim twitter, a note of finality and wistful deceit which they emit up to ten times per day, the poor little creatures. but in moniques case there could be no doubt she was, if anything, adding one or two years to her age. this i deduced from many details of her compact, neat, curiously immature body. having shed her clothes with fascinating rapidity, she stood for a moment partly wrapped in the dingy gauze of the window curtain listening with infantile pleasure, as pat as pat could be, to an organgrinder in the dustbrimming courtyard below. when i examined her small hands and drew her attention to their grubby fingernails, she said with a naive frown           oui, ce nest pas bien, and went to the washbasin, but i said it did not matter, did not matter at all. with her brown bobbed hair, luminous gray eyes and pale skin, she looked perfectly charming. her hips were no bigger than those of a squatting lad in fact, i do not hesitate to say and indeed this is the reason why i linger gratefully in that gauzegray room of memory with little monique that among the eighty or so          gruesi had had operate upon me, she was the only one that gave me a pang of genuine pleasure.           il etait malin, celui qui         a         invente ce trucla, she commented amiably, and got back into her clothes with the same highstyle speed.         i asked for another, more elaborate, assignment later the same evening, and she said she would meet me at the corner cafe at nine, and swore she had never          pose         un         lapinin all her young life. we returned to the same room, and i could not help saying how very pretty she was to which she answered demurely           tu es bien gentil de dire ca and then, noticing what i noticed too in the mirror reflecting our small edenthe dreadful grimace of clenchedteeth tenderness that distorted my mouthdutiful little monique oh, she had been a nymphet, all right wanted to know if she should remove the layer of red from her lips          avant quon se couchein case i planned to kiss her. of course, i planned it. i let myself go with her more completely than i had with any young lady before, and my last vision that night of longlashed monique is touched up with a gaiety that i find seldom associated with any event in my humiliating, sordid, taciturn love life. she looked tremendously pleased with the bonus of fifty i gave her as she trotted out into the april night drizzle with humbert humbert lumbering in her narrow wake. stopping before a window display she said with great gusto           je vais macheter des bas and never may i forget the way her parisian childish lips exploded on           bas, pronouncing it with an appetite that all but changed the a into a brief buoyant bursting o as in           bot.         i had a date with her next day at . p.m. in my own rooms, but it was less successful, she seemed to have grown less juvenile, more of a woman overnight. a cold i caught from her led me to cancel a fourth assignment, nor was i sorry to break an emotional series that threatened to burden me with heartrending fantasies and peter out in dull disappointment. so let her remain, sleek, slender monique, as she was for a minute or two a delinquent nymphet shining through the matteroffact young whore.         my brief acquaintance with her started a train of thought that may seem pretty obvious to the reader who knows the ropes. an advertisement in a lewd magazine landed me, one brave day, in the office of a mlle edith who began by offering me to choose a kindred soul from a collection of rather formal photographs in a rather soiled album           regardezmoi cette belle brune. when i pushed the album away and somehow managed to blurt out my criminal craving, she looked as if about to show me the door however, after asking me what price i was prepared to disburse, she condescended to put me in touch with a person          qui pourrait arranger la chose. next day, an asthmatic woman, coarsely painted, garrulous, garlicky, with an almost farcical provenal accent and a black mustache above a purple lip, took me to what was apparently her own domicile, and there, after explosively kissing the bunched tips of her fat fingers to signify the delectable rosebud quality of her merchandise, she theatrically drew aside a curtain to reveal what i judged was that part of the room where a large and unfastidious family usually slept. it was now empty save for a monstrously plump, sallow, repulsively plain girl of at least fifteen with redribboned thick black braids who sat on a chair perfunctorily nursing a bald doll. when i shook my head and tried to shuffle out of the trap, the woman, talking fast, began removing the dingy woolen jersey from the young giantess torso then, seeing my determination to leave, she demanded          son argent.a door at the end of the room was opened, and two men who had been dining in the kitchen joined in the squabble. they were misshapen, barenecked, very swarthy and one of them wore dark glasses. a small boy and a begrimed, bowlegged toddler lurked behind them. with the insolent logic of a nightmare, the enraged procuress, indicating the man in glasses, said he had served in the police,          lui, so that i had better do as i was told. i went up to mariefor that was her stellar namewho by then had quietly transferred her heavy haunches to a stool at the kitchen table and resumed her interrupted soup while the toddler picked up the doll. with a surge of pity dramatizing my idiotic gesture, i thrust a banknote into her indifferent hand. she surrendered my gift to the exdetective, whereupon i was suffered to leave.                                             i do not know if the pimps album may not have beeen another link in the daisychain but soon after, for my own safety, i decided to marry. it occurred to me that regular hours, homecooked meals, all the conventions of marriage, the prophylactic routine of its bedroom activities and, who knows, the eventual flowering of certain moral values, of certain spiritual substitutes, might help me, if not to purge myself of my degrading and dangerous desires, at least to keep them under pacific control. a little money that had come my way after my fathers death nothing very grandthe mirana had been sold long before, in addition to my striking if somewhat brutal good looks, allowed me to enter upon my quest with equanimity. after considerable deliberation, my choice fell on the daughter of a polish doctor the good man happened to be treating me for spells of dizziness and tachycardia. we played chess his daughter watched me from behind her easel, and inserted eyes or knuckles borrowed from me into the cubistic trash that accomplished misses then painted instead of lilacs and lambs. let me repeat with quiet force i was, and still am, despite          mes malheurs, an exceptionally handsome male slowmoving, tall, with soft dark hair and a gloomy but all the more seductive cast of demeanor. exceptional virility often reflects in the subjects displayable features a sullen and congested something that pertains to what he has to conceal. and this was my case. well did i know, alas, that i could obtain at the snap of my fingers any adult female i chose in fact, it had become quite a habit with me of not being too attentive to women lest they come toppling, bloodripe, into my cold lap. had i been a          francais moyenwith a taste for flashy ladies, i might have easily found, among the many crazed beauties that lashed my grim rock, creatures far more fascinating than valeria. my choice, however, was prompted by considerations whose essence was, as i realized too late, a piteous compromise. all of which goes to show how dreadfully stupid poor humbert always was in matters of sex.                                             although i told myself i was looking merely for a soothing presence, a glorified          potaufeu, an animated merkin, what really attracted me to valeria was the imitation she gave of a little girl. she gave it not because she had divined something about me it was just her styleand i fell for it. actually, she was at least in her late twenties i never established her exact age for even her passport lied and had mislaid her virginity under circumstances that changed with her reminiscent moods. i, on my part, was as naive as only a pervert can be. she looked fluffy and frolicsome, dressed          a la gamine, showed a generous amount of smooth leg, knew how to stress the white of a bare instep by the black of a velvet slipper, and pouted, and dimpled, and romped, and dirndled, and shook her short curly blond hair in the cutest and tritest fashion imaginable.         after a brief ceremony at the          mairie, i tool her to the new apartment i had rented and, somewhat to her surprise, had her wear, before i touched her, a girls plain nightshirt that i had managed to filch from the linen closet of an orphanage. i derived some fun from that nuptial night and had the idiot in hysterics by sunrise. but reality soon asserted itself. the bleached curl revealed its melanic root the down turned to prickles on a shaved shin the mobile moist mouth, no matter how i stuffed it with love, disclosed ignominiously its resemblance to the corresponding part in a treasured portrait of her toadlike dead mama and presently, instead of a pale little gutter girl, humbert humbert had on his hands a large, puffy, shortlegged, bigbreasted and practically brainless          baba.         this state of affairs lasted from  to . her only asset was a muted nature which did help to produce an odd sense of comfort in our small squalid flat two rooms, a hazy view in one window, a brick wall in the other, a tiny kitchen, a shoeshaped bath tub, within which i felt like marat but with no whitenecked maiden to stab me. we had quite a few cozy evenings together, she deep in her          parissoir, i working at a rickety table. we went to movies, bicycle races and boxing matches. i appealed to her stale flesh very seldom, only in cases of great urgency and despair. the grocer opposite had a little daughter whose shadow drove me mad but with valerias help i did find after all some legal outlets to my fantastic predicament. as to cooking, we tacitly dismissed the          potaufeuand had most of our meals at a crowded place in rue bonaparte where there were wine stains on the table cloth and a good deal of foreign babble. and next door, an art dealer displayed in his cluttered window a splendid, flamboyant, green, red, golden and inky blue, ancient american estampea locomotive with a gigantic smokestack, great baroque lamps and a tremendous cowcatcher, hauling its mauve coaches through the stormy prairie night and mixing a lot of sparkstudded black smoke with the furry thunder clouds.         these burst. in the summer of           mon         oncle damriquedied bequeathing me an annual income of a few thousand dollars on condition i came to live in the states and showed some interest in his business. this prospect was most welcome to me. i felt my life needed a shakeup. there was another thing, too moth holes had appeared in the plush of matrimonial comfort. during the last weeks i had kept noticing that my fat valeria was not her usual self had acquired a queer restlessness even showed something like irritation at times, which was quite out of keeping with the stock character she was supposed to impersonate. when i informed her we were shortly to sail for new york, she looked distressed and bewildered. there were some tedious difficulties with her papers. she had a nansen, or better say nonsense, passport which for some reason a share in her husbands solid swiss citizenship could not easily transcend and i decided it was the necessity of queuing in the          prfecture, and other formalities, that had made her so listless, despite my patiently describing to her america, the country of rosy children and great trees, where life would be such an improvement on dull dingy paris.         we were coming out of some office building one morning, with her papers almost in order, when valeria, as she waddled by my side, began to shake her poodle head vigorously without saying a word. i let her go on for a while and then asked if she thought she had something inside. she answered i translate from her french which was, i imagine, a translation in its turn of some slavic platitude there is another man in my life.         now, these are ugly words for a husband to hear. they dazed me, i confess. to beat her up in the street, there and then, as an honest vulgarian might have done, was not feasible. years of secret sufferings had taught me superhuman selfcontrol. so i ushered her into a taxi which had been invitingly creeping along the curb for some time, and in this comparative privacy i quietly suggested she comment her wild talk. a mounting fury was suffocating menot because i had any particular fondness for that figure of fun,          mme humbert, but because matters of legal and illegal conjunction were for me alone to decide, and here she was, valeria, the comedy wife, brazenly preparing to dispose in her own way of my comfort and fate. i demanded her lovers name. i repeated my question but she kept up a burlesque babble, discoursing on her unhappiness with me and announcing plans for an immediate divorce.           mais qui estce i shouted at last, striking her on the knee with my fist and she, without even wincing, stared at me as if the answer were too simple for words, then gave a quick shrug and pointed at the thick neck of the taxi driver. he pulled up at a small caf and introduced himself. i do not remember his ridiculous name but after all those years i still see him quite clearlya stocky white russian excolonel with a bushy mustache and a crew cut there were thousands of them plying that fools trade in paris. we sat down at a table the tsarist ordered wine, and valeria, after applying a wet napkin to her knee, went on talking          intome rather than to me she poured words into this dignified receptacle with a volubility i had never suspected she had in her. and every now and then she would volley a burst of slavic at her stolid lover. the situation was preposterous and became even more so when the taxicolonel, stopping valeria with a possessive smile, began to unfold          hisviews and plans. with an atrocious accent to his careful french, he delineated the world of love and work into which he proposed to enter hand in hand with his childwife valeria. she by now was preening herself, between him and me, rouging her pursed lips, tripling her chin to pick at her blousebosom and so forth, and he spoke of her as if she were absent, and also as if she were a kind of little ward that was in the act of being transferred, for her own good, from one wise guardian to another even wiser one and although my helpless wrath may have exaggerated and disfigured certain impressions, i can swear that he actually consulted me on such things as her diet, her periods, her wardrobe and the books she had read or should read. i think,he said, she will like          jean christophe oh, he was quite a scholar, mr. taxovich.         i put an end to this gibberish by suggesting valeria pack up her few belongings immediately, upon which the platitudinous colonel gallantly offered to carry them into the car. reverting to his professional state, he drove the humberts to their residence and all the way valeria talked, and humbert the terrible deliberated with humbert the small whether humbert humbert should kill her or her lover, or both, or neither. i remember once handling an automatic belonging to a fellow student, in the days i have not spoken of them, i think, but never mind when i toyed with the idea of enjoying his little sister, a most diaphanous nymphet with a black hair bow, and then shooting myself. i now wondered if valechka as the colonel called her was really worth shooting, or strangling, or drowning. she had very vulnerable legs, and i decided i would limit myself to hurting her very horribly as soon as we were alone.         but we never were. valechkaby now shedding torrents of tears tinged with the mess of her rainbow makeup,started to fill anyhow a trunk, and two suitcases, and a bursting carton, and visions of putting on my mountain boots and taking a running kick at her rump were of course impossible to put into execution with the cursed colonel hovering around all the time. i cannot say he behaved insolently or anything like that on the contrary, he displayed, as a small sideshow in the theatricals i had been inveigled in, a discreet oldworld civility, punctuating his movements with all sorts of mispronounced apologies           jai demande pardonneexcuse me          estce que jai puismay iand so forth, and turning away tactfully when valechka took down with a flourish her pink panties from the clothesline above the tub but he seemed to be all over the place at once,          le gredin, agreeing his frame with the anatomy of the flat, reading in my chair my newspaper, untying a knotted string, rolling a cigarette, counting the teaspoons, visiting the bathroom, helping his moll to wrap up the electric fan her father had given her, and carrying streetward her luggage. i sat with arms folded, one hip on the window sill, dying of hate and boredom. at last both were out of the quivering apartmentthe vibration of the door i had slammed after them still rang in my every nerve, a poor substitute for the backhand slap with which i ought to have hit her across the cheekbone according to the rules of the movies. clumsily playing my part, i stomped to the bathroom to check if they had taken my english toilet water they had not but i noticed with a spasm of fierce disgust that the former counselor of the tsar, after thoroughly easing his bladder, had not flushed the toilet. that solemn pool of alien urine with a soggy, tawny cigarette butt disintegrating in it struck me as a crowning insult, and i wildly looked around for a weapon. actually i daresay it was nothing but middleclass russian courtesy with an oriental tang, perhaps that had prompted the good colonel maximovich his name suddenly taxies back to me, a very formal person as they all are, to muffle his private need in decorous silence so as not to underscore the small size of his hosts domicile with the rush of a gross cascade on top of his own hushed trickle. but this did not enter my mind at the moment, as groaning with rage i ransacked the kitchen for something better than a broom. then, canceling my search, i dashed out of the house with the heroic decision of attacking him barefisted despite my natural vigor, i am no pugilist, while the short but broadshouldered maximovich seemed made of pig iron. the void of the street, revealing nothing of my wifes departure except a rhinestone button that she had dropped in the mud after preserving it for three unnecessary years in a broken box, may have spared me a bloody nose. but no matter. i had my little revenge in due time. a man from pasadena told me one day that mrs. maximovich ne zborovski had died in childbirth around  the couple had somehow got over to california and had been used there, for an excellent salary, in a yearlong experiment conducted by a distinguished american ethnologist. the experiment dealt with human and racial reactions to a diet of bananas and dates in a constant position on all fours. my informant, a doctor, swore he had seen with his own eyes obese valechka and her colonel, by then grayhaired and also quite corpulent, diligently crawling about the wellswept floors of a brightly lit set of rooms fruit in one, water in another, mats in a third and so on in the company of several other hired quadrupeds, selected from indigent and helpless groups. i tried to find the results of these tests in the          review of anthropology but they appear not to have been published yet. these scientific products take of course some time to fructuate. i hope they will be illustrated with photographs when they do get printed, although it is not very likely that a prison library will harbor such erudite works. the one to which i am restricted these days, despite my lawyers favors, is a good example of the inane eclecticism governing the selection of books in prison libraries. they have the bible, of course, and dickens an ancient set, n.y., g.w. dillingham, publisher, mdccclxxxvii and the          childrens encyclopediawith some nice photographs of sunshinehaired girl scouts in shorts, and          a murder is announcedby agatha christie but they also have such coruscating trifles as          a vagabond in italyby percy elphinstone, author of          venice revisited, boston, , and a comparatively recent           whos who in the limelightactors, producers, playwrights, and shots of static scenes. in looking through the latter volume, i was

my lolita, i have only words to play with                                             divorce proceedings delayed my voyage, and the gloom of yet another world war had settled upon the globe when, after a winter of ennui and pneumonia in portugal, i at last reached the states. in new york i eagerly accepted the soft job fate offered me it consisted mainly of thinking up and editing perfume ads. i welcomed its desultory character and pseudoliterary aspects, attending to it whenever i had nothing better to do. on the other hand, i was urged by a wartime university in new york to complete my comparative history of french literature for englishspeaking students. the first volume took me a couple of years during which i put in seldom less than fifteen hours of work daily. as i look back on those days, i see them divided tidily into ample light and narrow shade the light pertaining to the solace of research in palatial libraries, the shade to my excruciating desires and insomnias of which enough has been said. knowing me by now, the reader can easily imagine how dusty and hot i got, trying to catch a glimpse of nymphets alas, always remote playing in central park, and how repulsed i was by the glitter of deodorized career girls that a gay dog in one of the offices kept unloading upon me. let us skip all that. a dreadful breakdown sent me to a sanatorium for more than a year i went back to my workonly to be hospitalized again.         robust outdoor life seemed to promise me some relief. one of my favorite doctors, a charming cynical chap with a little brown beard, had a brother, and this brother was about to lead an expedition into arctic canada. i was attached to it as a recorder of psychic reactions. with two young botanists and an old carpenter i shared now and then never very successfully the favors of one of our nutritionists, a dr. anita johnsonwho was soon flown back, i am glad to say. i had little notion of what object the expedition was pursuing. judging by the number of meteorologists upon it, we may have been tracking to its lair somewhere on prince of wales island, i understand the wandering and wobbly north magnetic pole. one group, jointly with the canadians, established a weather station on pierre point in melville sound. another group, equally misguided, collected plankton. a third studied tuberculosis in the tundra. bert, a film photographeran insecure fellow with whom at one time i was made to partake in a good deal of menial work he, too, had some psychic troublesmaintained that the big men on our team, the real leaders we never saw, were mainly engaged in checking the influence of climatic amelioration on the coats of the arctic fox.         we lived in prefabricated timber cabins amid a precambrian world of granite. we had heaps of suppliesthe          readers digest, an ice cream mixer, chemical toilets, paper caps for christmas. my health improved wonderfully in spite or because of all the fantastic blankness and boredom. surrounded by such dejected vegetation as willow scrub and lichens permeated, and, i suppose, cleansed by a whistling gale seated on a boulder under a completely translucent sky through which, however, nothing of importance showed, i felt curiously aloof from my own self. no temptations maddened me. the plump, glossy little eskimo girls with their fish smell, hideous raven hair and guinea pig faces, evoked even less desire in me than dr. johnson had. nymphets do not occur in polar regions.         i left my betters the task of analyzing glacial drifts, drumlins, and gremlins, and kremlins, and for a time tried to jot down what i fondly thought were reactions i noticed, for instance, that dreams under the midnight sun tended to be highly colored, and this my friend the photographer confirmed. i was also supposed to quiz my various companions on a number of important matters, such as nostalgia, fear of unknown animals, foodfantasies, nocturnal emissions, hobbies, choice of radio programs, changes in outlook and so forth. everybody got so fed up with this that i soon dropped the project completely, and only toward the end of my twenty months of cold labor as one of the botanists jocosely put it concocted a perfectly spurious and very racy report that the reader will find published in he          annals of adult psychophysicsfor  or , as well as in the issue of          arctic explorationsdevoted to that particular expedition which, in conclusion, was not really concerned with victoria island copper or anything like that, as i learned later from my genial doctor for the nature of its real purpose was what is termed hushhush, and so let me add merely that whatever it was, that purpose was admirably achieved.         the reader will regret to learn that soon after my return to civilization i had another bout with insanity if to melancholia and a sense of insufferable oppression that cruel term must be applied. i owe my complete restoration to a discovery i made while being treated at that particular very expensive sanatorium. i discovered there was an endless source of robust enjoyment in trifling with psychiatrists cunningly leading them on never letting them see that you know all the tricks of the trade inventing for them elaborate dreams, pure classics in style which make          them, the dreamextortionists, dream and wake up shrieking teasing them with fake primal scenes and never allowing them the slightest glimpse of ones real sexual predicament. by bribing a nurse i won access to some files and discovered, with glee, cards calling me potentially homosexual and totally impotent. the sport was so excellent, its resultsin          mycaseso ruddy that i stayed on for a whole month after i was quite well sleeping admirably and eating like a schoolgirl. and then i added another week just for the pleasure of taking on a powerful newcomer, a displaced and, surely, deranged celebrity, known for his knack of making patients believe they had witnessed their own conception.                                             upon signing out, i cast around for some place in the new england countryside or sleepy small town elms, white church where i could spend a studious summer subsisting on a compact boxful of notes i had accumulated and bathing in some nearby lake. my work had begun to interest me againi mean my scholarly exertions the other thing, my active participation in my uncles posthumous perfumes, had by then been cut down to a minimum.         one of his former employees, the scion of a distinguished family, suggested i spend a few months in the residence of his impoverished cousins, a mr. mccoo, retired, and his wife, who wanted to let their upper story where a late aunt had delicately dwelt. he said they had two little daughters, one a baby, the other a girl of twelve, and a beautiful garden, not far from a beautiful lake, and i said it sounded perfectly perfect.         i exchanged letters with these people, satisfying them i was housebroken, and spent a fantastic night on the train, imagining in all possible detail the enigmatic nymphet i would coach in french and fondle in humbertish. nobody met me at the toy station where i alighted with my new expensive bag, and nobody answered the telephone eventually, however, a distraught mccoo in wet clothes turned up at the only hotel of greenandpink ramsdale with the news that his house had just burned downpossibly, owing to the synchronous conflagration that had been raging all night in my veins. his family, he said, had fled to a farm he owned, and had taken the car, but a friend of his wifes, a grand person, mrs. haze of  lawn street, offered to accommodate me. a lady who lived opposite mrs. hazes had lent mccoo her limousine, a marvelously oldfashioned, squaretopped affair, manned by a cheerful negro. now, since the only reason for my coming at all had vanished, the aforesaid arrangement seemed preposterous. all right, his house would have to be completely rebuilt, so what had he not insured it sufficiently i was angry, disappointed and bored, but being a polite european, could not refuse to be sent off to lawn street in that funeral car, feeling that otherwise mccoo would devise an even more elaborate means of getting rid of me. i saw him scamper away, and my chauffeur shook his head with a soft chuckle. en route, i swore to myself i would not dream of staying in ramsdale under any circumstance but would fly that very day to the bermudas or the bahamas or the blazes. possibilities of sweetness on technicolor beaches had been trickling through my spine for some time before, and mccoos cousin had, in fact, sharply diverted that train of thought with his wellmeaning but as it transpired now absolutely inane suggestion.         speaking of sharp turns we almost ran over a meddlesome suburban dog one of those who like in wait for cars as we swerved into lawn street. a little further, the haze house, a whiteframe horror, appeared, looking dingy and old, more gray than whitethe kind of place you know will have a rubber tube affixable to the tub faucet in lieu of shower. i tipped the chauffeur and hoped he would immediately drive away so that i might double back unnoticed to my hotel and bag but the man merely crossed to the other side of the street where an old lady was calling to him from her porch. what could i do i pressed the bell button.         a colored maid let me inand left me standing on the mat while she rushed back to the kitchen where something was burning that ought not to burn.         the front hall was graced with door chimes, a whiteeyed wooden thingamabob of commercial mexican origin, and that banal darling of the arty middle class, van goghs arlsienne. a door ajar to the right afforded a glimpse of a living room, with some more mexican trash in a corner cabinet and a striped sofa along the wall. there was a staircase at the end of the hallway, and as i stood mopping my brow only now did i realize how hot it had been outofdoors and staring, to stare at something, at an old gray tennis ball that lay on an oak chest, there came from the upper landing the contralto voice of mrs. haze, who leaning over the banisters inquired melodiously, is that monsieur humbert a bit of cigarette ash dropped from there in addition. presently, the lady herselfsandals, maroon slacks, yellow silk blouse, squarish face, in that ordercame down the steps, her index finger still tapping upon her cigarette.         i think i had better describe her right away, to get it over with. the poor lady was in her middle thirties, she had a shiny forehead, plucked eyebrows and quite simple but not unattractive features of a type that may be defined as a weak solution of marlene dietrich. patting her bronzebrown bun, she led me into the parlor and we talked for a minute about the mccoo fire and the privilege of living in ramsdale. her very wideset seagreen eyes had a funny way of traveling all over you, carefully avoiding your own eyes. her smile was but a quizzical jerk of one eyebrow and uncoiling herself from the sofa as she talked, she kept making spasmodic dashes at three ashtrays and the near fender where lay the brown core of an apple whereupon she would sink back again, one leg folded under her. she was, obviously, one of those women whose polished words may reflect a book club or bridge club, or any other deadly conventionality, but never her soul women who are completely devoid of humor women utterly indifferent at heart to the dozen or so possible subjects of a parlor conversation, but very particular about the rules of such conversations, through the sunny cellophane of which not very appetizing frustrations can be readily distinguished. i was perfectly aware that if by any wild chance i became her lodger, she would methodically proceed to do in regard to me what taking a lodger probably meant to her all along, and i would again be enmeshed in one of those tedious affairs i knew so well.         but there was no question of my settling there. i could not be happy in that type of household with bedraggled magazines on every chair and a kind of horrible hybridization between the comedy of socalled functional modern furniture and the tragedy of decrepit rockers and rickety lamp tables with dead lamps. i was led upstairs, and to the leftinto my room. i inspected it through the mist of my utter rejection of it but i did discern above my bed ren prinets kreutzer sonata. and she called that servant maids room a semistudio lets get out of here at once, i firmly said to myself as i pretended to deliberate over the absurdly, and ominously, low price that my wistful hostess was asking for board and bed.         oldworld politeness, however, obliged me to go on with the ordeal. we crossed the landing to the right side of the house where i and lo have our roomslo being presumably the maid, and the lodgerlover could hardly conceal a shudder when he, a very fastidious male, was granted a preview of the only bathroom, a tiny oblong between the landing and los room, with limp wet things overhanging the dubious tub the question mark of a hair inside and there were the expected coils of the rubber snake, and its complementa pinkish cozy, coyly covering the toilet lid.         i see you are not too favorably impressed, said the lady letting her hand rest for a moment upon my sleeve she combined a cool forwardnessthe overflow of what i think is called poisewith a shyness and sadness that caused her detached way of selecting her words to seem as unnatural as the intonation of a professor of speech. this is not a neat household, i confess, the doomed ear continued, but i assure you she looked at my lips, you will be very comfortable, very comfortable, indeed. let me show you the garden the last more brightly, with a kind of winsome toss of the voice.         reluctantly i followed her downstairs again then through the kitchen at the end of the hall, on the right side of the housethe side where also the dining room and the parlor were under my room, on the left, there was nothing but a garage. in the kitchen, the negro maid, a plump youngish woman, said, as she took her large glossy black purse from the knob of the door leading to the back porch ill go now, mrs. haze. yes, louise, answered mrs. haze with a sigh. ill settle with you friday. we passed on to a small pantry and entered the dining room, parallel to the parlor we had already admired. i noticed a white sock on the floor. with a deprecatory grunt, mrs. haze stooped without stopping and threw it into a closet next to the pantry. we cursorily inspected a mahogany table with a fruit vase in the middle, containing nothing but the still glistening stone of one plum. i groped for the timetable i had in my pocket and surreptitiously fished it out to look as soon as possible for a train. i was still walking behind mrs. haze though the dining room when, beyond it, there came a sudden burst of greenerythe piazza, sang out my leader, and then, without the least warning, a blue seawave swelled under my heart and, from a mat in a pool of sun, halfnaked, kneeling, turning about on her knees, there was my riviera love peering at me over dark glasses.         it was the same childthe same frail, honeyhued shoulders, the same silky supple bare back, the same chestnut head of hair. a polkadotted black kerchief tied around her chest hid from my aging ape eyes, but not from the gaze of young memory, the juvenile breasts i had fondled one immortal day. and, as if i were the fairytale nurse of some little princess lost, kidnaped, discovered in gypsy rags through which her nakedness smiled at the king and his hounds, i recognized the tiny darkbrown mole on her side. with awe and delight the king crying for joy, the trumpets blaring, the nurse drunk i saw again her lovely indrawn abdomen where my southbound mouth had briefly paused and those puerile hips on which i had kissed the crenulated imprint left by the band of her shortsthat last mad immortal day behind the roches roses. the twentyfive years i had lived since then, tapered to a palpitating point, and vanished.         i find it most difficult to express with adequate force that flash, that shiver, that impact of passionate recognition. in the course of the sunshot moment that my glance slithered over the kneeling child her eyes blinking over those stern dark spectaclesthe little herr doktor who was to cure me of all my aches while i passed by her in my adult disguise a great big handsome hunk of movieland manhood, the vacuum of my soul managed to suck in every detail of her bright beauty, and these i checked against the features of my dead bride. a little later, of course, she,          thos nouvelle, this lolita,          mylolita, was to eclipse completely her prototype. all i want to stress is that my discovery of her was a fatal consequence of that princedom by the sea in my tortured past. everything between the two events was but a series of gropings and blunders, and false rudiments of joy. everything they shared made one of them.         i have no illusions, however. my judges will regard all this as a piece of mummery on the part of a madman with a gross liking for the          fruit vert.          au fond,         a         mest bien gal.all i now is that while the haze woman and i went down the steps into the breathless garden, my knees were like reflections of knees in rippling water, and my lips were like sand, and         that was my lo, she said, and these are my lilies.         yes, i said, yes. they are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.                                             exhibit number two is a pocket diary bound in black imitation leather, with a golden year, ,          en escalier, in its upper lefthand corner. i speak of this neat product of the blank blank co., blankton, mass., as if it were really before me. actually, it was destroyed five years go and what we examine now by courtesy of a photographic memory is but its brief materialization, a puny unfledged phnix.         i remember the thing so exactly because i wrote it really twice. first i jotted down each entry in pencil with many erasures and corrections on the leaves of what is commercially known as a typewriter tablet then, i copied it out with obvious abbreviations in my smallest, most satanic, hand in the little black book just mentioned.         may  is

behind the house. strolled out. she wore a plaid shirt, blue jeans and sneakers. every movement she made in the dappled sun plucked at the most secret and sensitive chord of my abject body. after a

wife could decipher my microscopic script. let me state with a sob that today my l. was sunbathing on the socalled piazza, but her mother and some other woman were around all the time. of course, i might have sat there in the rocker and pretended to read. playing safe, i kept away, for i was afraid that the horrible, insane, ridiculous and pitiful tremor that palsied me might prevent me from making my          entrewith any semblance of casualness.                  sunday.heat ripple still with us a most favonian week. this time i took up a strategic position, with obese newspaper and new pipe, in the piazza rocker          beforel. arrived. to my intense disappointment she came with her mother, both in twopiece bathing suits, black, as new as my pipe. my darling, my sweetheart stood for a moment near mewanted the funniesand she smelt almost exactly like the other one, the riviera one, but more intensely so, with rougher overtonesa torrid odor that at once set my manhood astirbut she had already yanked out of me the coveted section and retreated to her mat near her phocine mamma. there my beauty lay down on her stomach, showing me, showing the thousand eyes wide open in my eyed blood, her slightly raised shoulder blades, and the bloom along the incurvation of her spine, and the swellings of her tense narrow nates clothed in black, and the seaside of her schoolgirl thighs. silently, the seventhgrader enjoyed her greenredblue comics. she was the loveliest nymphet greenredblue priap himself could think up. as i looked on, through prismatic layers of light, drylipped, focusing my lust and rocking slightly under my newspaper, i felt that my perception of her, if properly concentrated upon, might be sufficient to have me attain a beggars bliss immediately but, like some predator that prefers a moving prey to a motionless one, i planned to have this pitiful attainment coincide with the various girlish movements she made now and then as she read, such as trying to scratch the middle of her back and revealing a stippled armpitbut fat haze suddenly spoiled everything by turning to me and asking me for a light, and starting a makebelieve conversation about a fake book by some popular fraud.                  monday.         delectatio morosa.i spend my doleful days in dumps and dolors. we mother haze, dolores and i were to go to our glass lake this afternoon, and bathe, and bask but a nacreous morn degenerated at noon into rain, and lo made a scene.         the median age of pubescence for girls has been found to be thirteen years and nine months in new york and chicago. the age varies for individuals from ten, or earlier, to seventeen. virginia was not quite fourteen when harry edgar possessed her. he gave her lessons in algebra.          je mimagine cela.they spent their honeymoon at petersburg, fla. monsieur poepoe, as that boy in one of monsieur humbert humberts classes in paris called the poetpoet.         i have all the characteristics which, according to writers on the sex interests of children, start the responses stirring in a little girl cleancut jaw, muscular hand, deep sonorous voice, broad shoulder. moreover, i am said to resemble some crooner or actor chap on whom lo has a crush.                  tuesday. rain. lake of the rains. mamma out shopping. l., i knew, was somewhere quite near. in result of some stealthy maneuvering, i came across her in her mothers bedroom. prying her left eye open to get rid of a speck of something. checked frock. although i do love that intoxicating brown fragrance of hers, i really think she should wash her hair once in a while. for a moment, we were both in the same warm green bath of the mirror that reflected the top of a poplar with us in the sky. held her roughly by the shoulders, then tenderly by the temples, and turned her about. its right there, she said. i can feel it. swiss peasant would use the top of her tongue. lick it out yeth. shly try sure, she said. gently i pressed my quivering sting along her rolling salty eyeball. goodygoody, she said nictating. it          isgone. now the other you dope, she began, there is noth but here she noticed the pucker of my approaching lips. okay, she said cooperatively, and bending toward her warm upturned russet face somber humbert pressed his mouth to her fluttering eyelid. she laughed, and brushed past me out of the room. my heart seemed everywhere at once. never in my lifenot even when fondling my childlove in francenever         night. never have i experienced such agony. i would like to describe her face, her waysand i cannot, because my own desire for her blinds me when she is near. i am not used to being with nymphets, damn it. if i close my eyes i see but an immobilized fraction of her, a cinematographic still, a sudden smooth nether loveliness, as with one knee up under her tartan skirt she sits tying her shoe. dolores haze,          ne nontrez pas vos zhambes this is her mother who thinks she knows french.         a poet          mes heures, i composed a madrigal to the sootblack lashes of her palegray vacant eyes, to the five asymmetrical freckles on her bobbed nose, to the blond down of her brown limbs but i tore it up and cannot recall it today. only in the tritest of terms diary resumed can i describe los features i might say her hair is auburn, and her lips as red as licked red candy, the lower one prettily plumpoh, that i were a lady writer who could have her pose naked in a naked light but instead i am lanky, bigboned, woolychested humbert humbert, with thick black eyebrows and a queer accent, and a cesspoolful of rotting monsters behind his slow boyish smile. and neither is she the fragile child of a feminine novel. what drives me insane is the twofold nature of this nymphetof every nymphet, perhaps this mixture in my lolita of tender dreamy childishness and a kind of eerie vulgarity, stemming from the snubnosed cuteness of ads and magazine pictures, from the blurry pinkness of adolescent maidservants in the old country smelling of crushed daisies and sweat and from very young harlots disguised as children in provincial brothels and then again, all this gets mixed up with the exquisite stainless tenderness seeping through the musk and the mud, through the dirt and the death, oh god, oh god. and what is most singular is that she,          thislolita,          mylolita, has individualized the writers ancient lust, so that above and over everything there islolita.                  wednesday.look, make mother take you and me to our glass lake tomorrow. these were the textual words said to me by my twelveyearold flame in a voluptuous whisper, as we happened to bump into one another on the front porch, i out, she in. the reflection of the afternoon sun, a dazzling white diamond with innumerable iridescent spikes quivered on the round back of a parked car. the leafage of a voluminous elm played its mellow shadows upon the clapboard wall of the house. two poplars shivered and shook. you could make out the formless sounds of remote traffic a child calling nancy, nancy in the house, lolita had put on her favorite little carmen record which i used to call dwarf conductors, making her snort with mock derision at my mock wit.                  thursday.last night we sat on the piazza, the haze woman, lolita and i. warm dusk had deepened into amorous darkness. the old girl had finished relating in great detail the plot of a movie she and l. had seen sometime in the winter. the boxer had fallen extremely low when he met the good old priest who had been a boxer himself in his robust youth and could still slug a sinner. we sat on cushions heaped on the floor, and l. was between the woman and me she had squeezed herself in, the pet. in my turn, i launched upon a hilarious account of my arctic adventures. the muse of invention handed me a rifle and i shot a white bear who sat down and said ah all the while i was acutely aware of l.s nearness and as i spoke i gestured in the merciful dark and took advantage of those invisible gestures of mine to touch her hand, her shoulder and a ballerina of wool and gauze which she played with and kept sticking into my lap and finally, when i had completely enmeshed my glowing darling in this weave of ethereal caresses, i dared stroke her bare leg along the gooseberry fuzz of her shin, and i chuckled at my own jokes, and trembled, and concealed my tremors, and once or twice felt with my rapid lips the warmth of her hair as i treated her to a quick nuzzling, humorous aside and caressed her plaything. she, too, fidgeted a good deal so that finally her mother told her sharply to quit it and sent the doll flying into the dark, and i laughed and addressed myself to haze across los legs to let my hand creep up my nymphets thin back and feel her skin through her boys shirt.         but i knew it was all hopeless, and was sick with longing, and my clothes felt miserably tight, and i was almost glad when her mothers quiet voice announced in the dark and now we all think that lo should go to bed. i think you stink, said lo. which means there will be no picnic tomorrow, said haze. this is a free country, said lo. when angry lo with a bronx cheer had gone, i stayed on from sheer inertia, while haze smoked her tenth cigarette of the evening and complained of lo.         she had been spiteful, if you please, at the age of one, when she used to throw her toys out of her crib so that her poor mother should keep picking them up, the villainous infant now, at twelve, she was a regular pest, said haze. all she wanted from life was to be one day a strutting and prancing baton twirler or a jitterbug. her grades were poor, but she was better adjusted in her new school than in pisky pisky was the haze home town in the middle west. the ramsdale house was her late motherinlaws. they had moved to ramsdale less than two years ago. why was she unhappy there oh, said haze, poor me should know, i went through that when          iwas a kid boys twisting ones arm, banging into one with loads of books, pulling ones hair, hurting ones breasts, flipping ones skirt. of course, moodiness is a common concomitant of growing up, but lo exaggerates. sullen and evasive. rude and defiant. struck viola, an italian schoolmate, in the seat with a fountain pen. know what i would like if you, monsieur, happened to be still here in the fall, id ask you to help her with her homeworkyou seem to know everything, geography, mathematics, french. oh, everything, answered monsieur. that means, said haze quickly, youll          behere i wanted to shout that i would stay on eternally if only i could hope to caress now and then my incipient pupil. but i was wary of haze. so i just grunted and stretched my limbs nonconcomitantly           le mot juste and presently went up to my room. the woman, however, was evidently not prepared to call it a day. i was already lying upon my cold bed both hands pressing to my face lolitas fragrant ghost when i heard my indefatigable landlady creeping stealthily up to my door to whisper through itjust to make sure, she said, i was through with the glance and gulp magazine i had borrowed the other day. from her room lo yelled          shehad it. we are quite a lending library in this house, thunder of god.                  friday.i wonder what my academic publishers would say if i were to quote in my textbook ronsards           la vermeillette fente or remy belleaus           un petit mont feutr de mousse dlicate, trac sur le milieu dun fillet escarlatte and so forth. i shall probably have another breakdown if i stay any longer in this house, under the strain of this intolerable temptation, by the side of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride. has she already been initiated by mother nature to the mystery of the menarche bloated feelings. the curse of the irish. falling from the roof. grandma is visiting. mr. uterus i quote from a girls magazine starts to build a thick soft wall on the chance a possible baby may have to be bedded down there. the tiny madman in his padded cell.         incidentally if i ever commit a serious murder mark the if. the urge should be something more than the kind of thing that happened to me with valeria. carefully mark that          thenwas rather inept. if and when you wish to sizzle me to death, remember that only a spell of insanity could ever give me the simple energy to be a brute all this amended, perhaps. sometimes i attempt to kill in my dreams. but do you know what happens for instance i hold a gun. for instance i aim at a bland, quietly interested enemy. oh, i press the trigger all right, but one bullet after another feebly drops on the floor from the sheepish muzzle. in those dreams, my only thought is to conceal the fiasco from my foe, who is slowly growing annoyed.         at dinner tonight the old cat said to me with a sidelong gleam of motherly mockery directed at lo i had just been describing, in a flippant vein, the delightful little toothbrush mustache i had not quite decided to grow better dont if somebody is not to go absolutely dotty. instantly lo pushed her plate of boiled fish away, all but knocking her milk over, and bounced out of the dining room. would it bore you very much, quoth haze, to come with us tomorrow for a swim in our glass lake if lo apologizes for her manners         later, i heard a great banging of doors and other sounds coming from quaking caverns where the two rivals were having a ripping row.         she had not apologized. the lake is out. it might have been fun.                  saturday.for some days already i had been leaving the door ajar, while i wrote in my room but only today did the trap work. with a good deal of additional fidgeting, shuffling, scrapingto disguise her embarrassment at visiting me without having been calledlo came in and after pottering around, became interested in the nightmare curlicues i had penned on a sheet of paper. oh no they were not the outcome of a bellelettrists inspired pause between two paragraphs they were the hideous hieroglyphics which she could not decipher of my fatal lust. as she bent her brown curs over the desk at which i was sitting, humbert the hoarse put his arm around her in a miserable imitation of bloodrelationship and still studying, somewhat shortsightedly, the piece of paper she held, my innocent little visitor slowly sank to a halfsitting position upon my knee. her adorable profile, parted lips, warm hair were some three inches from my bared eyetooth and i felt the heat of her limbs through her rough tomboy clothes. all at once i knew i could kiss her throat or the wick of her mouth with perfect impunity. i knew she would let me do so, and even close her eyes as hollywood teaches. a double vanilla with hot fudgehardly more unusual than that. i cannot tell my learned reader whose eyebrows, i suspect, have by now traveled all the way to the back of his bald head, i cannot tell him how the knowledge came to me perhaps my apeear had unconsciously caught some slight change in the rhythm of her respirationfor now she was not really looking at my scribble, but waiting with curiosity and composureoh, my limpid nymphetfor the glamorous lodger to do what he was dying to do. a modern child, an avid reader of movie magazines, an expert in dreamslow closeups, might not think it too strange, i guessed, if a handsome, intensely

inflated pale spiders you see in old gardens. sitting in the middle of a luminous web and giving little jerks to this or that strand.          myweb is spread all over the house as i listen from my chair where i sit like a wily wizard. is lo in her room gently i tug on the silk. she is not. just heard the toilet paper cylinder make its staccato sound as it is turned and no footfalls has my

elsewhere about the house for the beautiful warmcolored prey. let us have a strand of silk descend the stairs. i satisfy myself by this means that she is not in the kitchennot banging the refrigerator

through to the parlor and find the radio silent and mamma still talking to mrs. chatfield or mrs. hamilton, very softly, flushed, smiling, cupping the telephone with her free hand, denying by implication that she denies those amusing rumors, rumor, roomer, whispering intimately, as she never does, the clearcut lady, in face to face talk. so my nymphet is not in the house at all gone what i thought was a prismatic weave turns out to be but an old gray cobweb, the house is empty, is dead. and then comes lolitas soft sweet chuckle through my halfopen door dont tell mother but ive eaten          allyour bacon. gone when i scuttle out of my room. lolita, where are you my breakfast tray, lovingly prepared by my landlady, leers at me toothlessly, ready to be taken in. lola, lolita                  tuesday.clouds again interfered with that picnic on that unattainable lake. is it fate scheming yesterday i tried on before the mirror a new pair of bathing trunks.                  wednesday.in the afternoon, haze commonsensical shoes, tailormade dress, said she was driving downtown to buy a present for a friend of a friend of hers, and would i please come too because i have such a wonderful taste in textures and perfumes. choose your favorite seduction, she purred. what could humbert, being in the perfume business, do she had me cornered between the front porch and her car. hurry up, she said as i laboriously doubled up my large body in order to crawl in still desperately devising a means of escape. she had started the engine, and was genteelly swearing at a backing and turning truck in front that had just brought old invalid miss opposite a brand new wheel chair, when my lolitas sharp voice came from the parlor window you where are you going im coming too wait ignore her, yelped haze killing the motor alas for my fair driver lo was already pulling at the door on my side. this is intolerable, began haze but lo had scrambled in, shivering with glee. move your bottom, you, said lo. lo cried haze sideglancing at me, hoping i would throw rude lo out. and behold, said lo not for the first time, as she jerked back, as i jerked back, as the car leapt forward. it is intolerable, said haze, violently getting into second, that a child should be so illmannered. and so very persevering. when she knows she is unwanted. and needs a bath.         my knuckles lay against the childs blue jeans. she was barefooted her toenails showed remnants of cherryred polish and there was a bit of adhesive tape across her big toe and, god, what would i not have given to kiss then and there those delicateboned, longtoed, monkeyish feet suddenly her hand slipped into mine and without our chaperons seeing, i held, and stroked, and squeezed that little hot paw, all the way to the store. the wings of the divers marlenesque nose shone, having shed or burned up their ration of powder, and she kept up an elegant monologue anent the local traffic, and smiled in profile, and pouted in profile, and beat her painted lashes in profile, while i prayed we would never get to that store, but we did.         i have nothing else to report, save,          primothat big haze had little haze sit behind on our way home, and          secundothat the lady decided to keep humberts choice for the backs of her own shapely ears.                  thursday.we are paying with hail and gale for the tropical beginning of the month. in a volume of the          young peoples encyclopedia, i found a map of the states that a childs pencil had started copying out on a sheet of lightweight paper, upon the other side of which, counter to the unfinished outline of florida and the gulf, there was a mimeographed list of names referring, evidently, to her class at the ramsdale school. it is a poem i know already by heart.                                 angel, grace             austin, floyd             beale, jack             beale, mary             buck, daniel             byron,

and sweet was it to discover this haze, dolores she in its special bower of names, with its bodyguard of rosesa fairy princess between her two maids of honor. i am trying to analyze the spinethrill of delight it gives me, this name among all those others. what is it that excites me almost to tears hot, opalescent, thick tears that poets and lovers shed what is it the tender anonymity of this name with its formal veil dolores and that abstract transposition of first name and surname, which is like a pair of new pale gloves or a mask is mask the keyword is it because there is always delight in the semitranslucent mystery, the flowing charshaf, through which the flesh and the eye you alone are elected to know smile in passing at you alone or is it because i can imagine so well the rest of the colorful classroom around my dolorous and hazy darling grace and her ripe pimples ginny and her lagging leg gordon, the haggard masturbator duncan, the foulsmelling clown nailbiting agnes viola, of the blackheads and the bouncing bust pretty rosaline dark mary rose adorable stella, who has let strangers touch her ralph, who bullies and steals irving, for whom i am sorry. and there she is there, lost in the middle, gnawing a pencil, detested by teachers, all the boys eyes on her hair and neck,          mylolita.                  friday.i long for some terrific disaster. earthquake. spectacular explosion. her mother is messily but instantly and permanently eliminated, along with everybody else for miles around. lolita whimpers in my arms. a free man, i enjoy her among the ruins. her surprise, my explanations, demonstrations, ullulations. idle and idiotic fancies a brave humbert would have played with her most disgustingly yesterday, for instance, when she was again in my room to show me her drawings, schoolartware he might have bribed herand got away with it. a simpler and more practical fellow would have soberly stuck to various commercial substitutesif you know where to go, i dont. despite my many looks, i am horribly timid. my romantic soul gets all clammy and shivery at the thought of running into some awful indecent unpleasantness. those ribald sea monsters.           mais allezy, allezy annabel skipping on one foot to get into her shorts, i seasick with rage, trying to screen her.         same date, later, quite late. i have turned on the light to take down a dream. it had an evident antecedent. haze at dinner had benevolently proclaimed that since the weather bureau promised a sunny weekend we would go to the lake sunday after church. as i lay in bed, erotically musing before trying to go to sleep, i thought of a final scheme how to profit by the picnic to come. i was aware that mother haze hated my darling for her being sweet on me. so i planned my lake day with a view to satisfying the mother. to her alone would i talk but at some appropriate moment i would say i had left my wrist watch or my sunglasses in that glade yonderand plunge with my nymphet into the wood. reality at this juncture withdrew, and the quest for the glasses turned into a quiet little orgy with a singularly knowing, cheerful, corrupt and compliant lolita behaving as reason knew she could not possibly behave. at  a.m. i swallowed a sleeping pill, and presently, a dream that was not a sequel but a parody revealed to me, with a kind of meaningful clarity, the lake i had never yet visited it was glazed over with a sheet of emerald ice, and a pockmarked eskimo was trying in vain to break it with a pickax, although imported mimosas and oleanders flowered on its gravelly banks. i am sure dr. blanche schwarzmann would have paid me a sack of schillings for adding such a libidream to her files. unfortunately, the rest of it was frankly eclectic. big haze and little haze rode on horseback around the lake, and i rode too, dutifully bobbing up and down, bowlegs astraddle although there was no horse between them, only elastic airone of those little omissions due to the absentmindedness of the dream agent.                  saturday. my heart is still thumping. i still squirm and emit low moans of remembered embarrassment.         dorsal view. glimpse of shiny skin between tshirt and white gym shorts. bending, over a window sill, in the act of tearing off leaves from a poplar outside while engrossed in torrential talk with a newspaper boy below kenneth knight, i suspect who had just propelled the ramsdale          journalwith a very precise thud onto the porch. i began creeping up to hercrippling up to her as pantomimists say. my arms and legs were convex surfaces between whichrather than upon whichi slowly progressed by some neutral means of locomotion humbert the wounded spider. i must have taken hours to reach her i seemed to see her through the wrong end of a telescope, and toward her taut little rear i moved like some paralytic, on soft distorted limbs, in terrible concentration. at last i was right behind her when i had the unfortunate idea of blustering a trifleshaking her by the scruff of the neck and that sort of thing to cover my real          mange, and she said in a shrill brief whine cut it outmost coarsely, the little wench, and with a ghastly grin humbert the humble beat a gloomy retreat while she went on wisecracking streetward.         but now listen to what happened next. after lunch i was reclining in a low chair trying to read. suddenly two deft little hands were over my eyes she had crept up from behind as if reenacting, in a ballet sequence, my morning maneuver. her fingers were a luminous crimson as they tried to blot out the sun, and she uttered hiccups of laughter and jerked this way and that as i stretched my arm sideways and backwards without otherwise changing my recumbent position. my hand swept over her agile giggling legs, and the book like a sleigh left my lap, and mrs. haze strolled up and said indulgently just slap her hard if she interferes with your scholarly meditations. how i love this garden no exclamation mark in her tone. isnt it divine in the sun no question mark either. and with a sign of feigned content, the obnoxious lady sank down on the grass and looked up at the sky as she leaned back on her splayedout hands, and presently an old gray tennis ball bounced over her, and los voice came from the house haughtily           pardonnez,mother. i was not aiming at          you. of course not, my hot downy darling.                                             this proved to be the last of twenty entries or so. it will be seem from them that for all the devils inventiveness, the scheme remained daily the same. first he would tempt meand then thwart me, leaving me with a dull pain in the very root of my being. i knew exactly what i wanted to do, and how to do it, without impinging on a childs chastity after all, i had had          someexperience in my life of pederosis had visually possessed dappled nymphets in parks had wedged my wary and bestial way into the hottest, most crowded corner of a city bus full of straphanging school children. but for almost three weeks i had been interrupted in all my pathetic machinations. the agent of these interruptions was usually the haze woman who, as the reader will mark, was more afraid of los deriving some pleasure from me than of my enjoying lo. the passion i had developed for that nymphetfor the first nymphet in my life that could be reached at last by my awkward, aching, timid clawswould have certainly landed me again in a sanatorium, had not the devil realized that i was to be granted some relief if he wanted to have me as a plaything for some time longer.         the reader has also marked the curious mirage of the lake. it would have been logical on the part of aubrey mcfate as i would like to dub that devil of mine to arrange a small treat for me on the promised beach, in the presumed forest. actually, the promise mrs. haze had made was a fraudulent one she had not told me that mary rose hamilton a dark little beauty in her own right was to come too, and that the two nymphets would be whispering apart, and playing apart, and having a good time all by themselves, while mrs. haze and her handsome lodger conversed sedately in the seminude, far from prying eyes. incidentally, eyes did pry and tongues did wag. how queer life is we hasten to alienate the very fates we intended to woo. before my actual arrival, my landlady had planned to have an old spinster, a miss phalen, whose mother had been cook in mrs. hazes family, come to stay in the house with lolita and me, while mrs. haze, a career girl at heart, sought some suitable job in the nearest city. mrs. haze had seen the whole situation very clearly the bespectacled, roundbacked herr humbert coming with his centraleuropean trunks to gather dust in his corner behind a heap of old books the unloved ugly little daughter firmly supervised by miss phalen who had already once had my lo under her buzzard wing lo recalled that  summer with an indignant shudder and mrs. haze herself engaged as a receptionist in a great elegant city. but a not too complicated event interfered with that program. miss phalen broke her hip in savannah, ga., on the very day i arrived in ramsdale.                                             the sunday after the saturday already described proved to be as bright as the weatherman had predicted. when putting the breakfast things back on the chair outside my room for my good landlady to remove at her convenience, i gleaned the following situation by listening from the landing across which i had softly crept to the banisters in my old bedroom slippersthe only old things about me.         there had been another row. mrs. hamilton had telephoned that her daughter was running a temperature. mrs. haze informed          herdaughter that the picnic would have to be postponed. hot little haze informed big cold haze that, if so, she would not go with her to church. mother said very well and left.         i had come out on the landing straight after shaving, soapyearlobed, still in my white pajamas with the cornflower blue not the lilac design on the back i now wiped off the soap, perfumed my hair and armpits, slipped on a purple silk dressing gown, and, humming nervously, went down the stairs in quest of lo.         i want my learned readers to participate in the scene i am about to replay i want them to examine its every detail and see for themselves how careful, how chaste, the whole winesweet event is if viewed with what my lawyer has called, in a private talk we have had, impartial sympathy. so let us get started. i have a difficult job before me.         main character humbert the hummer. time sunday morning in june. place sunlit living room. props old, candystriped davenport, magazines, phonograph, mexican knickknacks the late mr. harold e. hazegod bless the good manhad engendered my darling at the siesta hour in a bluewashed room, on a honeymoon trip to vera cruz, and mementoes, among these dolores, were all over the place. she wore that day a pretty print dress that i had seen on her once before, ample in the skirt, tight in the bodice, shortsleeved, pink, checkered with darker pink, and, to complete the color scheme, she had painted her lips and was holding in her hollowed hands a beautiful, banal, edenred apple. she was not shod, however, for church. and her white sunday purse lay discarded near the phonograph.         my heart beat like a drum as she sat down, cool skirt ballooning, subsiding, on the sofa next to me, and played with her glossy fruit. she tossed it up into the sundusted air, and caught itit made a cupped polished          plot.         humbert humbert intercepted the apple.         give it back,she pleaded, showing the marbled flush of her palms. i produced delicious. she grasped it and bit into it, and my heart was like snow under thin crimson skin, and with the nonkeyish nimbleness that was so typical of that american nymphet, she snatched out of my abstract grip the magazine i had opened pity no film had recorded the curious pattern, the monogrammic linkage of our simultaneous or overlapping moves. rapidly, hardly hampered by the disfigured apple she held, lo flipped violently through the pages in search of something she wished humbert to see. found it at last. i faked interest by bringing my head so close that her hair touched my temple and her arm brushed my cheek as she wiped her lips with her wrist. because of the burnished mist through which i peered at the picture, i was slow in reacting to it, and her bare knees rubbed and knocked impatiently against each other. dimly there came into view a surrealist painter relaxing, supine, on a beach, and near him, likewise supine, a plaster replica of the venus di milo, halfburied in sand. picture of the week, said the legend. i whisked the whole obscene thing away. next moment, in a sham effort to retrieve it, she was all over me. caught her by her thin knobby wrist. the magazine escaped to the floor like a flustered fowl. she twisted herself free, recoiled, and lay back in the righthand corner of the davenport. then, with perfect simplicity, the impudent child extended her legs across my lap.         by this time i was in a state of excitement bordering on insanity but i also had the cunning of the insane. sitting there, on the sofa, i managed to attune, by a series of stealthy movements, my masked lust to her guileless limbs. it was no easy matter to divert the little maidens attention while i performed the obscure adjustments necessary for the success of the trick. talking fast, lagging behind my own breath, catching up with it, mimicking a sudden toothache to explain the breaks in my patterand all the while keeping a maniacs inner eye on my distant golden goal, i cautiously increased the magic friction that was doing away, in an illusional, if not factual, sense, with the physically irremovable, but psychologically very friable texture of the material divide pajamas and robe between the weight of two sunburnt legs, resting athwart my lap, and the hidden tumor of an unspeakable passion. having, in the course of my patter, hit upon something nicely mechanical, i recited, garbling them slightly, the words of a foolish song that was then popularo my carmen, my little carmen, something, something, those something nights, and the stars, and the cars, and the bars, and the barmen i kept repeating this automatic stuff and holding her under its special spell spell because of the garbling, and all the while i was mortally afraid that some act of god might interrupt me, might remove the golden load in the sensation of which all my being seemed concentrated, and this anxiety forced me to work, for the first minute or so, more hastily than was consensual with deliberately modulated enjoyment. the stars that sparkled, and the cars that parkled, and the bars, and the barmen, were presently taken over by her her voice stole and corrected the tune i had been mutilating. she was musical and applesweet. her legs twitched a little as they lay across my live lap i stroked them there she lolled in the righthand corner, almost asprawl, lola the bobbysoxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice, losing her slipper, rubbing the heel of her slipperless foot in its sloppy anklet, against the pile of old magazines heaped on my left on the sofaand every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beautybetween my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock.         under my glancing finger tips i felt the minute hairs bristle ever so slightly along her shins. i lost myself in the pungent but healthy heat which like summer haze hung about little haze. let her stay, let her stay as she strained to chuck the core of her abolished apple into the fender, her young weight, her shameless innocent shanks and round bottom, shifted in my tense, tortured, surreptitiously laboring lap and all of a sudden a mysterious change came over my senses. i entered a plane of being where nothing mattered, save the infusion of joy brewed within my body. what had begun as a delicious distention of my innermost roots became a glowing tingle which          nowhad reached that state of absolute security, confidence and reliance not found elsewhere in conscious life. with the deep hot sweetness thus established and well on its way to the ultimate convulsion, i felt i could slow down in order to prolong the glow. lolita had been safely solipsized. the implied sun pulsated in the supplied poplars we were fantastically and divinely alone i watched her, rosy, golddusted, beyond the veil of my controlled delight, unaware of it, alien to it, and the sun was on her lips, and her lips were apparently still forming the words of the carmenbarmen ditty that no longer reached my consciousness. everything was now ready. the nerves of pleasure had been laid bare. the corpuscles of krause were entering the phase of frenzy. the least pressure would suffice to set all paradise loose. i had ceased to be humbert the hound, the sadeyed degenerate cur clasping the boot that would presently kick him away. i was above the tribulations of ridicule, beyond the possibilities of retribution. in my selfmade seraglio, i was a radiant and robust turk, deliberately, in the full consciousness of his freedom, postponing the moment of actually enjoying the youngest and frailest of his slaves. suspended on the brink of that voluptuous abyss a nicety of physiological equipoise comparable to certain techniques in the arts i kept repeating the chance words after herbarmen, alarmin, my charmin, my carmen, ahmen, ahahamenas one talking and laughing in his sleep while my happy hand crept up her sunny leg as far as the shadow of decency allowed. the day before she had collided with the heavy chest in the hall andlook, looki gaspedlook what youve done, what youve done to yourself, ah, look for there was, i swear, a yellowishviolet bruise on her lovely nymphet thigh which my huge hairy hand massaged and slowly envelopedand because of her very perfunctory underthings, there seemed to be nothing to prevent my muscular thumb from reaching the hot hollow of her groinjust as you might tickle and caress a giggling childjust thatand oh, its nothing at all, she cried with a sudden shrill note in her voice, and she wiggled, and squirmed, and threw her head back, and her teeth rested on her glistening underlip as she halfturned away, and my moaning mouth, gentlemen of the jury, almost reached her bare neck, while i crushed out against her left buttock the last throb of the longest ecstasy man or monster had ever known.         immediately afterward as if we had been struggling and now my grip had eased she rolled off the sofa and jumped to her feetto her foot, ratherin order to attend to the formidably loud telephone that may have been ringing for ages as far as i was concerned. there she stood and blinked, cheeks aflame, hair awry, her eyes passing over me as lightly as they did over the furniture, and as she listened or spoke to her mother who was telling her to come to lunch with her at the chatfiledsneither lo nor hum knew yet what busybody haze was plotting, she kept tapping the edge of the table with the slipper she held in her hand. blessed be the lord, she had noticed nothing         with a handkerchief of multicolored silk, on which her listening eyes rested in passing, i wiped the sweat off my forehead, and, immersed in a euphoria of release, rearranged my royal robes. she was still at the telephone, haggling with her mother wanted to be fetched by car, my little carmen when, singing louder and louder, i swept up the stairs and set a deluge of steaming water roaring into the tub.         at this point i may as well give the words of that song hit in fullto the best of my recollection at leasti dont think i ever had it right. here goes         o my carmen, my little carmen         something, something those something nights,         and the stars, and the cars, and the bars and the barmen         and, o my charmin, our dreadful fights.         and the something town where so gaily, arm in         arm, we went, and our final row,         and the gun i killed you with, o my carmen,         the gun i am holding now.         drew his . automatic, i guess, and put a bullet through his molls eye.                                             i had lunch in townhad not been so hungry for years. the house was still loless when i strolled back. i spent the afternoon musing, scheming, blissfully digesting my experience of the morning.         i felt proud of myself. i had stolen the honey of a spasm without impairing the morals of a minor. absolutely no harm done. the conjurer had poured milk, molasses, foaming champagne into a young ladys new white purse and lo, the purse was intact. thus had i delicately constructed my ignoble, ardent, sinful dream and still lolita was safeand i was safe. what i had madly possessed was not she, but my own creation, another, fanciful lolitaperhaps, more real than lolita overlapping, encasing her floating between me and her, and having no will, no consciousnessindeed, no life of her own.         the child knew nothing. i had done nothing to her. and nothing prevented me from repeating a performance that affected her as little as if she were a photographic image rippling upon a screen and i a humble hunchback abusing myself in the dark. the afternoon drifted on and on, in ripe silence, and the sappy tall trees seemed to be in the know and desire, even stronger than before, began to afflict me again. let her come soon, i prayed, addressing a loan god, and while mamma is in the kitchen, let a repetition of the davenport scene be staged, please, i adore her so horribly.         no horribly is the wrong word. the elation with which the vision of new delights filled me was not horrible but pathetic. i qualify it as pathetic. patheticbecause despite the insatiable fire of my venereal appetite, i intended, with the most fervent force and foresight, to protect the purity of that twelveyearold child.         and now see how i was repaid for my pains. no lolita came homeshe had gone with the chatfields to a movie. the table was laid with more elegance than usual candlelight, if you please. in this mawkish aura, mrs. haze gently touched the silver on both sides of her plate as if touching piano keys, and smiled down on her empty plate was on a diet, and said she hoped i liked the salad recipe lifted from a womans magazine. she hoped i liked the cold cuts, too. it had been a perfect day. mrs. chatfield was a lovely person. phyllis, her daughter, was going to a summer camp tomorrow. for three weeks. lolita, it was decided, would go thursday. instead of waiting till july, as had been initially planned. and stay there after phyllis had left. till school began. a pretty prospect, my heart.         oh, how i was taken abackfor did it not mean i was losing my darling, just when i had secretly made her mine to explain my grim mood, i had to use the same toothache i had already simulated in the morning. must have been an enormous molar, with an abscess as big as a maraschino cherry.         we have, said haze, an excellent dentist. our neighbor, in fact. dr. quilty. uncle or cousin, i think, of the playwright. think it will pass well, just as you wish. in the fall i shall have him brace her, as my mother used to say. it may curb lo a little. i am afraid she has been bothering you frightfully all these days. and we are in for a couple of stormy ones before she goes. she has flatly refused to go, and i confess i left her with the chatfields because i dreaded to face her alone just yet. the movie may mollify her. phyllis is a very sweet girl, and there is no earthly reason for lo to dislike her. really, monsieur, i am very sorry about that tooth of yours. it would be so much more reasonable to let me contact ivor quilty first thing tomorrow morning if it still hurts. and, you know, i think a summer camp is so much healthier, andwell, it is all so much more          reasonableas i say than to mope on a suburban lawn and use mammas lipstick, and pursue shy studious gentlemen, and go into tantrums at the least provocation.         are you sure, i said at last, that she will be happy there lame, lamentably lame         shed better, said haze. and it wont be all play either. the camp is run by shirley holmesyou know, the woman who wrote          campfire girl. camp will teach dolores haze to grow in many thingshealth, knowledge, temper. and particularly in a sense of responsibility towards other people. shall we take these candles with us and sit for a while on the piazza, or do you want to go to bed and nurse that tooth         nurse that tooth.                                             next day they drove downtown to buy things needed for the camp any wearable purchase worked wonders with lo. she seemed her usual sarcastic self at dinner. immediately afterwards, she went up to her room to plunge into the comic books acquired for rainy days at camp q they were so thoroughly sampled by thursday that she left them behind. i too retired to my lair, and wrote letters. my plan now was to leave for the seaside and then, when school began, resume my existence in the haze household for i knew already that i could not live without the child. on tuesday they went shopping again, and i was asked to answer the phone if the camp mistress rang up during their absence. she did and a month or so later we had occasion to recall our pleasant chat. that tuesday, lo had her dinner in her room. she had been crying after a routine row with her mother and, as had happened on former occasions, had not wished me to see her swollen eyes she had one of those tender complexions that after a good cry get all blurred and inflamed, and morbidly alluring. i regretted keenly her mistake about my private aesthetics, for i simply love that tinge of botticellian pink, that raw rose about the lips, those wet, matted eyelashes and, naturally, her bashful whim deprived me of many opportunities of specious consolation. there was, however, more to it than i thought. as we sat in the darkness of the verandah a rude wind had put out her red candles, haze, with a dreary laugh, said she had told lo that her beloved humbert thoroughly approved of the whole camp idea and now, added haze, the child throws a fit pretext you and i want to get rid of her actual reason i told her we would exchange tomorrow for plainer stuff some much too cute night things that she bullied me into buying for her. you see,          shesees herself as a starlet          isee her as a sturdy, healthy, but decidedly homely kid. this, i guess, is at the root of our troubles.         on wednesday i managed to waylay lo for a few seconds she was on the landing, in sweatshirt and greenstained white shorts, rummaging in a trunk. i said something meant to be friendly and funny but she only emitted a snort without looking at me. desperate, dying humbert patted her clumsily on her coccyx, and she struck him, quite painfully, with one of the late mr. hazes shoetrees. doublecrosser, she said as i crawled downstairs rubbing my arm with a great show of rue. she did not condescend to have dinner with hum and mum washed her hair and went to bed with her ridiculous books. and on thursday quiet mrs. haze drove her to camp q.         as greater authors than i have put it let readers imagine etc. on second thought, i may as well give those imaginations a kick in the pants. i knew i had fallen in love with lolita forever but i also knew she would not be forever lolita. she would be thirteen on january . in two years or so she would cease being a nymphet and would turn into a young girl, and then, into a college girlthat horror of horrors. the word forever referred only to my own passion, to the eternal lolita as reflected in my blood. the lolita whose iliac crests had not yet flared, the lolita that today i could touch and smell and hear and see, the lolita of the strident voice and rich brown hairof the bangs and the swirls and the sides and the curls at the back, and the sticky hot neck, and the vulgar vocabularyrevolting, super, luscious, goon, drip          thatlolita,          mylolita, poor catullus would lose forever. so how could i afford not to see her for two months of summer insomnias two whole months out of the two years of her remaining nymphage should i disguise myself as a somber oldfashioned girl, gawky mlle humbert, and put up my tent on the outskirts of camp q, in the hope that its russet nymphets would clamor let us adopt that deepvoiced d.p., and drag the said, shyly smiling berthe          au grand piedto their rustic hearth. berthe will sleep with dolores haze         idle dry dreams. two months of beauty, two months of tenderness, would be squandered forever, and i could do nothing about it, but nothing,          mais rien.         one drop of rare honey, however, that thursday did hold in its acorn cup. haze was to drive her to the camp in the early morning. upon sundry sounds of departure reaching me, i rolled out of bed and leaned out of the window. under the poplars, the car was already athrob. on the sidewalk, louise stood shading her eyes with her hand, as if the little traveler were already riding into the low morning sun. the gesture proved to be premature. hurry up shouted haze. my lolita, who was half in and about to slam the car door, wind down the glass, wave to louise and the poplars whom and which she was never to see again, interrupted the motion of fate she looked upand dashed back into the house haze furiously calling after her. a moment later i heard my sweetheart running up the stairs. my heart expanded with such force that it almost blotted me out. i hitched up the pants of my pajamas, flung the door open and simultaneously lolita arrived, in her sunday frock, stamping, panting, and then she was in my arms, her innocent mouth melting under the ferocious pressure of dark male jaws, my palpitating darling the next instant i heart heralive, unrapedclatter downstairs. the motion of fate was resumed. the blond leg was pulled in, the car door was slammedwas reslammedand driver haze at the violent wheel, rubberred lips writhing in angry, inaudible speech, swung my darling away, while unnoticed by them or louise, old miss opposite, an invalid, feebly but rhythmically waved from her vined verandah.                                             the hollow of my hand was still ivoryfull of lolitafull of the feel of her preadolescently incurved back, that ivorysmooth, sliding sensation of her skin through the thin frock that i had worked up and down while i held her. i marched into her tumbled room, threw open the door of the closet, and plunged into a heap of crumpled things that had touched her. there was particularly one pink texture, sleazy, torn, with a faintly acrid odor in the seam. i wrapped in it humberts huge engorged heart. a poignant chaos was welling within mebut i had to drop those things and hurriedly regain my composure, as i became aware of the maids velvety voice calling me softly from the stairs. she had a message for me, she said and, topping my automatic thanks with a kindly youre welcome, good louise left an unstamped, curiously cleanlooking letter in my shaking hand.                             this is a confession. i love you so the letter began and for a distorted moment i mistook its hysterical scrawl for a schoolgirls scribble. last sunday in churchbad you, who refused to come to see our beautiful new windowsonly last sunday, my dear one, when i asked the lord what to do about it, i was told to act as i am acting now. you see, there is no alternative. i have loved you from the minute i saw you. i am a passionate and lonely woman and you are the love of my life.           now, my dearest, dearest,            mon cher, cher monsieur, you have read this now you know. so, will you please,            at once, pack and leave. this is a landladys order. i am dismissing a lodger. i am kicking you out. go scram            departezi shall be back by dinnertime, if i do eighty both ways and dont have an accident but what would it matter, and i do not wish to find you in the house. please, please, leave at once,            now, do not even read this absurd note to the end. go. adieu.           the situation,            chri,is quite simple. of course, i know with            absolute certaintythat i am nothing to you, nothing at all to you, nothing at all. oh yes, you enjoy talking to me and kidding poor me, you have grown fond of our friendly house, of the books i like, of my lovely garden, even of los noisy waysbut i am nothing to you. right right. nothing to you whatever.            butif, after reading my confession, you decided, in your dark romantic european way, that i am attractive enough for you to take advantage of my letter and make a pass at me, then you would be a criminalworse than a kidnaper who rapes a child. you see,            chri. ifyou decided to stay,            ifi found you at home which i know i wontand thats why i am able to go on like this, the            factof your remaining would only mean one thing that you want me as much as i do you as a lifelong mate and that you are ready to link up your life with mine forever and ever and be a father to my little girl.           let me rave and ramble on for a teeny while more, my dearest, since i know this letter has been by now torn by you, and its pieces illegible in the vortex of the toilet. my dearest,            mon trs, trs cher, what a world of love i have built up for you during this miraculous june i know how reserved you are, how british. your oldworld reticence, your sense of decorum may be shocked by the boldness of an american girl you who conceal your strongest feelings must think me a shameless little idiot for throwing open my poor bruised heart like this. in years gone by, many disappointments came my way. mr. haze was a splendid person, a sterling soul, but he happened to be twenty years my senior, andwell, let us not gossip about the past. my dearest, your curiosity must be well satisfied if you have ignored my request and read this letter to the bitter end. never mind. destroy it and go. do not forget to leave the key on the desk in your room. and some scrap of address so that i could refund the twelve dollars i owe you till the end of the month. goodbye, dear one. pray for meif you ever pray.           c.h.                           what i present here is what i remember of the letter, and what i remember of the letter i remember verbatim including that awful french. it was at least twice longer. i have left out a lyrical passage which i more or less skipped at the time, concerning lolitas brother who died at  when she was , and how much i would have liked him. let me see what else can i say yes. there is just a chance that the vortex of the toilet where the letter did go is my own matteroffact contribution. she probably begged me to make a special fire to consume it.         my first movement was one of repulsion and retreat. my second was like a friends calm hand falling upon my shoulder and bidding me take my time. i did. i came out of my daze and found myself still in los room. a fullpage ad ripped out of a slick magazine was affixed to the wall above the bed, between a crooners mug and the lashes of a movie actress. it represented a darkhaired young husband with a kind of drained look in his irish eyes. he was modeling a robe by soandso and holding a bridgelike tray by soandso, with breakfast for two. the legend, by the rev. thomas morell, called him a conquering hero. the thoroughly conquered lady not shown was presumably propping herself up to receive her half of the tray. how her bedfellow was to get under the bridge without some messy mishap was not clear. lo had drawn a jocose arrow to the haggard lovers face and had put, in block letters h.h. and indeed, despite a difference of a few years, the resemblance was striking. under this was another picture, also a colored ad. a distinguished playwright was solemnly smoking a drome. he always smoked dromes. the resemblance was slight. under this was los chase bed, littered with comics. the enamel had come off the bedstead, leaving black, more or less rounded, marks on the white. having convinced myself that louise had left, i got into los bed and reread the letter.                                             gentlemen of the jury i cannot swear that certain motions pertaining to the business in handif i may coin an expressionhad not drifted across my mind before. my mind had not retained them in any logical form or in any relation to definitely recollected occasions but i cannot swearlet me repeatthat i had not toyed with them to rig up yet another expression, in my dimness of thought, in my darkness of passion. there may have been timesthere must have been times, if i know my humbertwhen i had brought up for detached inspection the idea of marrying a mature widow say, charlotte haze with not one relative left in the wide gray world, merely in order to have my way with her child lo, lola, lolita. i am even prepared to tell my tormentors that perhaps once or twice i had cast an appraisers cold eye at charlottes coral lips and bronze hair and dangerously low neckline, and had vaguely tried to fit her into a plausible daydream. this i confess under torture. imaginary torture, perhaps, but all the more horrible. i wish i might digress and tell you more of the          pavor nocturnusthat would rack me at night hideously after a chance term had struck me in the random readings of my boyhood, such as          peine forte et durewhat a genius of pain must have invented that or the dreadful, mysterious, insidious words trauma, traumatic event, and transom. but my tale is sufficiently incondite already.         after a while i destroyed the letter and went to my room, and ruminated, and rumpled my hair, and modeled my purple robe, and moaned through clenched teeth and suddenlysuddenly, gentlemen of the jury, i felt a dostoevskian grin dawning through the very grimace that twisted my lips like a distant and terrible sun. i imagined under conditions of new and perfect visibility all the casual caresses her mothers husband would be able to lavish on his lolita. i would hold her against me three times a day, every day. all my troubles would be expelled, i would be a healthy man. to hold thee lightly on a gentle knee and print on thy soft cheek a parents kiss wellread humbert         then, with all possible caution, on mental tiptoe so to speak, i conjured up charlotte as a possible mate. by god, i could make myself bring her that economically halved grapefruit, that sugarless breakfast.         humbert humbert sweating in the fierce white light, and howled at, and trodden upon by sweating policemen, is now ready to make a further statement           quel mot as he turns his conscience inside out and rips off its innermost lining. i did not plan to marry poor charlotte in order to eliminate her in some vulgar, gruesome and dangerous manner such as killing her by placing five bichlorideofmercury tablets in her preprandial sherry or anything like that but a delicately allied, pharmacopoeial thought did tinkle in my sonorous and clouded brain. why limit myself to the modest masked caress i had tried already other visions of venery presented themselves to me swaying and smiling. i saw myself administering a powerful sleeping potion to both mother and daughter so as to fondle the latter though the night with perfect impunity. the house was full of charlottes snore, while lolita hardly breathed in her sleep, as still as a painted girlchild. mother, i swear kenny never even          touchedme. you either lie, dolores haze, or it was an incubus. no, i would not go that far.         so humbert the cubus schemed and dreamedand the red sun of desire and decision the two things that create a live world rose higher and higher, while upon a succession of balconies a succession of libertines, sparkling glass in hand, toasted the bliss of past and future nights. then, figuratively speaking, i shattered the glass, and boldly imagined for i was drunk on those visions by then and underrated the gentleness of my nature how eventually i might blackmailno, that it too strong a wordmauvemail big haze into letting me consort with the little haze by gently threatening the poor doting big dove with desertion if she tried to bar me from playing with my legal stepdaughter. in a word, before such an amazing offer, before such a vastness and variety of vistas, i was as helpless as adam at the preview of early oriental history, miraged in his apple orchard.         and now take down the following important remark the artist in me has been given the upper hand over the gentleman. it is with a great effort of will that in this memoir i have managed to tune my style to the tone of the journal that i kept when mrs. haze was to me but an obstacle. that journal of mine is no more but i have considered it my artistic duty to preserve its intonations no matter how false and brutal they may seem to me now. fortunately, my story has reached a point where i can cease insulting poor charlotte for the sake of retrospective verisimilitude.         wishing to spare poor charlotte two or three hours of suspense on a winding road and avoid, perhaps, a headon collision that would shatter our different dreams, i made a thoughtful but abortive attempt to reach her at the camp by telephone. she had left half an hour before, and getting lo instead, i told hertrembling and brimming with my mastery over fatethat i was going to marry her mother. i had to repeat it twice because something was preventing her from giving me her attention. gee, thats swell, she said laughing. when is the wedding hold on a sec, the pupthat put here has got hold of my sock. listen and she added she guessed she was going to have loads of fun and i realized as i hung up that a couple of hours at that camp had been sufficient to blot out with new impressions the image of handsome humbert humbert from little lolitas mind. but what did it matter now i would get her back as soon as a decent amount of time after the wedding had elapsed. the orange blossom would have scarcely withered on the grave, as a poet might have said. but i am no poet. i am only a very conscientious recorder.         after louise had gone, i inspected the icebox, and finding it much too puritanic, walked to town and bought the richest foods available. i also bought some good liquor and two or three kinds of vitamins. i was pretty sure that with the aid of these stimulants and my natural resources, i would avert any embarrassment that my indifference might incur when called upon to display a strong and impatient flame. again and again resourceful humbert evoked charlotte as seen in the rareeshow of a manly imagination. she was well groomed and shapely, this i could say for her, and she was my lolitas big sisterthis notion, perhaps, i could keep up if only i did not visualize too realistically her heavy hips, round knees, ripe bust, the coarse pink skin of her neck coarse by comparison with silk and honey and all the rest of that sorry and dull thing a handsome woman.         the sun made its usual round of the house as the afternoon ripened into evening. i had a drink. and another. and yet another. gin and pineapple juice, my favorite mixture, always double my energy. i decided to busy myself with our unkempt lawn.          une petite attention.it was crowded with dandelions, and a cursed dogi loathe dogshad defiled the flat stones where a sundial had once stood. most of the dandelions had changed from suns to moons. the gin and lolita were dancing in me, and i almost fell over the folding chairs that i attempted to dislodge. incarnadine zebras there are some eructations that sound like cheersat least, mine did. an old fence at the back of the garden separated us from the neighbors garbage receptacles and lilacs but there was nothing between the front end of our lawn where it sloped along one side of the house and the street. therefore i was able to watch with the smirk of one about to perform a good action for the return of charlotte that tooth should be extracted at once. as i lurched and lunged with the hand mower, bits of grass optically twittering in the low sun, i kept an eye on that section of suburban street. it curved in from under an archway of huge shade trees, then sped towards us down, down, quite sharply, past old miss opposites ivied brick house and highsloping lawn much trimmer than ours and disappeared behind our own front porch which i could not see from where i happily belched and labored. the dandelions perished. a reek of sap mingled with the pineapple. two little girls, marion and mabel, whose comings and goings i had mechanically followed of late but who could replace my lolita went toward the avenue from which our lawn street cascaded, one pushing a bicycle, the other feeding from a paper bag, both talking at the top of their sunny voices. leslie, old miss opposites gardener and chauffeur, a very amiable and athletic negro, grinned at me from afar and shouted, reshouted, commented by gesture, that i was mighty energetic today. the fool dog of the prosperous junk dealer next door ran after a blue carnot charlottes. the prettier of the two little girls mabel, i think, shorts, halter with little to halt, bright haira nymphet, by panran back down the street crumpling her paper bag and was hidden from this green goat by the frontage of mr. and mrs. humberts residence. a station wagon popped out of the leafy shade of the avenue, dragging some of it on its roof before the shadows snapped, and swung by at an idiotic pace, the sweatshirted driver roofholding with his left hand and the junkmans dog tearing alongside. there was a smiling pauseand then, with a flutter in my breast, i witnessed the return of the blue sedan. i saw it glide downhill and disappear behind the corner of the house. i had a glimpse of her calm pale profile. it occurred to me that until she went upstairs she would not know whether i had gone or not. a minute later, with an expression of great anguish on her face, she looked down at me from the window of los room. by sprinting upstairs, i managed to reach that room before she left it.                                             when the bride is a window and the groom is a widower when the former has lived in our great little town for hardly two years, and the latter for hardly a month when monsieur wants to get the whole damned thing over with as quickly as possible, and madame gives in with a tolerant smile then, my reader, the wedding is generally a quiet affair. the bride may dispense with a tiara of orange blossoms securing her fingertip veil, nor does she carry a white orchid in a prayer book. the brides little daughter might have added to the ceremonies uniting h. and h. a touch of vivid vermeil but i knew i would not dare be too tender with cornered lolita yet, and therefore agreed it was not worth while tearing the child away from her beloved camp q.         my          soidisantpassionate and lonely charlotte was in everyday life matteroffact and gregarious. moreover, i discovered that although she could not control her heart or her cries, she was a woman of principle. immediately after she had become more or less my mistress despite the stimulants, her nervous, eager          chria heroic          chri         had some initial trouble, for which, however, he amply compensated her by a fantastic display of oldworld endearments, good charlotte interviewed me about my relations with god. i could have answered that on that score my mind was open i said, insteadpaying my tribute to a pious platitudethat i believed in a cosmic spirit. looking down at her fingernails, she also asked me had i not in my family a certain strange strain. i countered by inquiring whether she would still want to marry me if my fathers maternal grandfather had been, say, a turk. she said it did not matter a bit but that, if she ever found out i did not believe in our christian god, she would commit suicide. she said it so solemnly that it gave me the creeps. it was then i knew she was a woman of principle.         oh, she was very genteel she said excuse me whenever a slight burp interrupted her flowing speech, called an envelope and ahnvelope, and when talking to her ladyfriends referred to me as mr. humbert. i thought it would please her if i entered the community trailing some glamour after me. on the day of our wedding a little interview with me appeared in the society column of the ramsdale          journal, with a photograph of charlotte, one eyebrow up and a misprint in her name hazer. despite this contretempts, the publicity warmed the porcelain cockles of her heartand made my rattles shake with awful glee. by engaging in church work as well as by getting to know the better mothers of los schoolmates, charlotte in the course of twenty months or so had managed to become if not a prominent, at least an acceptable citizen, but never before had she come under that thrilling          rubrique, and it was i who put her there, mr. edgar h. humbert i threw in the edgar just for the heck of it, writer and explorer. mccoos brother, when taking it down, asked me what i had written. whatever i told him came out as several books on peacock, rainbow and other poets. it was also noted that charlotte and i had known each other for several years and that i was a distant relation of her first husband. i hinted i had had an affair with her thirteen years ago but this was not mentioned in print. to charlotte i said that society columns          shouldcontain a shimmer of errors.         let us go on with this curious tale. when called upon to enjoy my promotion from lodger to lover, did i experience only bitterness and distaste no. mr. humbert confesses to a certain titillation of his vanity, to some faint tenderness, even to a pattern of remorse daintily running along the steel of his conspiratorial dagger. never had i thought that the rather ridiculous, through rather handsome mrs. haze, with her blind faith in the wisdom of her church and book club, her mannerisms of elocution, her harsh, cold, contemptuous attitude toward an adorable, downyarmed child of twelve, could turn into such a touching, helpless creature as soon as i laid my hands upon her which happened on the threshold of lolitas room whither she tremulously backed repeating no, no, please no.         the transformation improved her looks. her smile that had been such a contrived thing, thenceforth became the radiance of utter adorationa radiance having something soft and moist about it, in which, with wonder, i recognized a resemblance to the lovely, inane, lost look that lo had when gloating over a new kind of concoction at the soda fountain or mutely admiring my expensive, always tailorfresh clothes. deeply fascinated, i would watch charlotte while she swapped parental woes with some other lady and made that national grimace of feminine resignation eyes rolling up, mouth drooping sideways which, in an infantile form, i had seen lo making herself. we had highballs before turning in, and with their help, i would manage to evoke the child while caressing the mother. this was the white stomach within which my nymphet had been a little curved fish in . this carefully dyed hair, so sterile to my sense of smell and touch, acquired at certain lamplit moments in the poster bed the tinge, if not the texture, of lolitas curls. i kept telling myself, as i wielded my brandnew largeaslife wife, that biologically this was the nearest i could get to lolita that at lolitas age, lotte had been as desirable a schoolgirl as her daughter was, and as lolitas daughter would be some day. i had my wife unearth from under a collection of shoes mr. haze had a passion for them, it appears a thirtyyearold album, so that i might see how lotte had looked as a child and even though the light was wrong and the dresses graceless, i was able to make out a dim first version of lolitas outline, legs, cheekbones, bobbed nose. lottelita, lolitchen.         so i tompeeped across the hedges of years, into wan little windows. and when, by means of pitifully ardent, naively lascivious caresses, she of the noble nipple and massive thigh prepared me for the performance of my nightly duty, it was still a nymphets scent that in despair i tried to pick up, as i bayed through the undergrowth of dark decaying forests.         i simply cant tell you how gentle, how touching my poor wife was. at breakfast, in the depressingly bright kitchen, with its chrome glitter and hardware and co. calendar and cute breakfast nook simulating that coffee shoppe where in their college days charlotte and humbert used to coo together, she would sit, robed in red, her elbow on the plastictopped table, her cheek propped on her fist, and stare at me with intolerable tenderness as i consumed my ham and eggs. humberts face might twitch with neuralgia, but in her eyes it vied in beauty and animation with the sun and shadows of leaves rippling on the white refrigerator. my solemn exasperation was to her the silence of love. my small income added to her even smaller one impressed her as a brilliant fortune not because the resulting sum now sufficed for most middleclass needs, but because even my money shone in her eyes with the magic of my manliness, and she saw our joint account as one of those southern boulevards at midday that have solid shade on one side and smooth sunshine on the other, all the way to the end of a prospect, where pink mountains loom.         into the fifty days of our cohabitation charlotte crammed the activities of as many years. the poor woman busied herself with a number of things she had foregone long before or had never been much interested in, as if to prolong these proustian intonations by my marrying the mother of the child i loved i had enabled my wife to regain an abundance of youth by proxy. with the zest of a banal young bride, she started to glorify the home. knowing as i did its every cranny by heartsince those days when from my chair i mentally mapped out lolitas course through the housei had long entered into a sort of emotional relationship with it, with its very ugliness and dirt, and now i could almost feel the wretched thing cower in its reluctance to endure the bath of ecru and ocher and puttbuffandsnuff that charlotte planned to give it. she never got as far as that, thank god, but she did use up a tremendous amount of energy in washing window shades, waxing the slats of venetian blinds, purchasing new shades and new blinds, returning them to the store, replacing them by others, and so on, in a constant chiaroscuro of smiles and frowns, doubts and pouts. she dabbled in cretonnes and chintzes she changed the colors of the sofathe sacred sofa where a bubble of paradise had once burst in slow motion within me. she rearranged the furnitureand was pleased when she found, in a household treatise, that it is permissible to separate a pair of sofa commodes and their companion lamps. with the authoress of          your home is you, she developed a hatred for little lean chairs and spindle tables. she believed that a room having a generous expanse of glass, and lots of rich wood paneling was an example of the masculine type of room, whereas the feminine type was characterized by lighterlooking windows and frailer woodwork. the novels i had found her reading when i moved in were now replaced by illustrated catalogues and homemaking guides. from a firm located at  roosevelt blvd., philadelphia, she ordered for our double bed a damask covered  coil mattressalthough the old one seemed to me resilient and durable enough for whatever it had to support.         a midwesterner, as her late husband had also been, she had lived in coy ramsdale, the gem of an eastern state, not long enough to know all the nice people. she knew slightly the jovial dentist who lived in a kind of ramshackle wooden chateau behind our lawn. she had met at a church tea the snooty wife of the local junk dealer who owned the colonial white horror at the corner of the avenue. now and then she visited with old miss opposite but the more patrician matrons among those she called upon, or met at lawn functions, or had telephone chats withsuch dainty ladies as mrs. glave, mrs. sheridan, mrs. mccrystal, mrs. knight and others, seldom seemed to call on my neglected charlotte. indeed, the only couple with whom she had relations of real cordiality, devoid of any          arrirepenseor practical foresight, were the farlows who had just come back from a business trip to chile in time to attend our wedding, with the chatfields, mccoos, and a few others but not mrs. junk or the even prouder mrs. talbot. john farlow was a middleaged, quiet, quietly athletic, quietly successful dealer in sporting goods, who had an office at parkington, forty miles away it was he who got me the cartridges for that colt and showed me how to use it, during a walk in the woods one sunday he was also what he called with a smile a parttime lawyer and had handled some of charlottes affairs. jean, his youngish wife and first cousin, was a longlimbed girl in harlequin glasses with two boxer dogs, two pointed breasts and a big red mouth. she paintedlandscapes and portraitsand vividly do i remember praising, over cocktails, the picture she had made of a niece of hers, little rosaline honeck, a rosy honey in a girl scout uniform, beret of green worsted, belt of green webbing, charming shoulderlong curlsand john removed his pipe and said it was a pity dolly my dolita and rosaline were so critical of each other at school, but he hoped, and we all hoped, they would get on better when they returned from their respective camps. we talked of the school. it had its drawbacks, and it had its virtues. of course, too many of the tradespeople here are italians, said john, but on the other hand we are still spared i wish, interrupted jean with a laugh, dolly and rosaline were spending the summer together. suddenly i imagined lo returning from campbrown, warm, drowsy, druggedand was ready to weep with passion and impatience.                                             a few words more about mrs. humbert while the going is good a bad accident is to happen quite soon. i had been always aware of the possessive streak in her, but i never thought she would be so crazily jealous of anything in my life that had not been she. she showed a fierce insatiable curiosity for my past. she desired me to resuscitate all my loves so that she might make me insult them, and trample upon them, and revoke them apostately and totally, thus destroying my past. she made me tell her about my marriage to valeria, who was of course a scream but i also had to invent, or to pad atrociously, a long series of mistresses for charlottes morbid delectation. to keep her happy, i had to present her with an illustrated catalogue of them, all nicely differentiated, according to the rules of those american ads where schoolchildren are pictured in a subtle ratio of races, with oneonly one, but as cute as they make themchocolatecolored roundeyed little lad, almost in the very middle of the front row. so i presented my women, and had them smile and swaythe languorous blond, the fiery brunette, the sensual copperheadas if on parade in a bordello. the more popular and platitudinous i made them, the more mrs. humbert was pleased with the show.         never in my life had i confessed so much or received so many confessions. the sincerity and artlessness with which she discussed what she called her lovelife, from first necking to connubial catchascatchcan, were, ethically, in striking contrast with my glib compositions, but technically the two sets were congeneric since both were affected by the same stuff soap operas, psychoanalysis and cheap novelettes upon which i drew for my characters and she for her mode of expression. i was considerably amused by certain remarkable sexual habits that the good harold haze had had according to charlotte who thought my mirth improper but otherwise her autobiography was as devoid of interests as her autopsy would have been. i never saw a healthier woman than she, despite thinning diets.         of my lolita she seldom spokemore seldom, in fact, than she did of the blurred, blond male baby whose photograph to the exclusion of all others adorned our bleak bedroom. in once of her tasteless reveries, she predicted that the dead infants soul would return to earth in the form of the child she would bear in her present wedlock. and although i felt no special urge to supply the humbert line with a replica of harolds production lolita, with an incestuous thrill, i had grown to regard as          mychild, it occurred to me that a prolonged confinement, with a nice cesarean operation and other complications in a safe maternity ward sometime next spring, would give me a chance to be alone with my lolita for weeks, perhapsand gorge the limp nymphet with sleeping pills.         oh, she simply hated her daughter what i thought especially vicious was that she had gone out of her way to answer with great diligence the questionnaires in a fools book she had           a guide to your childs development, published in chicago. the rigmarole went year by year, and mom was supposed to fill out a kind of inventory at each of her childs birthdays. on los twelfth, january , , charlotte haze, ne becker, had underlined the following epithets, ten out of forty, under your childs personality aggressive, boisterous, critical, distrustful, impatient, irritable, inquisitive, listless, negativistic underlined twice and obstinate. she had ignored the thirty remaining adjectives, among which were cheerful, cooperative, energetic, and so forth. it was really maddening. with a brutality that otherwise never appeared in my loving wifes mild nature, she attacked and routed such of los little belongings that had wandered to various parts of the house to freeze there like so many hypnotized bunnies. little did the good lady dream that one morning when an upset stomach the result of my trying to improve on her sauces had prevented me from accompanying her to church, i deceived her with one of lolitas anklets. and then, her attitude toward my saporous darlings letters         dear mummy and hummy,         hope you are fine. thank you very much for the candy. i crossed out and rewritten again i lost my new sweater in the woods. it has been cold here for the last few days. im having a time. love,         dolly.         the dumb child, said mrs. humbert, has left out a word before time. that sweater was allwool, and i wish you would not send her candy without consulting me.                                             there was a woodlake hourglass lakenot as i had thought it was spelled a few miles from ramsdale, and there was one week of great heat at the end of july when we drove there daily. i am now obliged to describe in some tedious detail our last swim there together, one tropical tuesday morning.         we had left the car in a parking area not far from the road and were making our way down a path cut through the pine forest to the lake, when charlotte remarked that jean farlow, in quest of rare light effects jean belonged to the old school of painting, had seen leslie taking a dip in the ebony as john had quipped at five oclock in the morning last sunday.         the water, i said, must have been quite cold.         that is not the point, said the logical doomed dear. he is subnormal, you see. and, she continued in that carefully phrased way of hers that was beginning to tell on my health, i have a very definite feeling our louise is in love with that moron.         feeling. we feel dolly is not doing as well etc. from an old school report.         the humberts walked on, sandaled and robed.         do you know, hum i have one most ambitious dream, pronounced lady hum, lowering her headshy of that dreamand communing with the tawny ground. i would love to get hold of a real trained servant maid like that german girl the talbots spoke of and have her live in the house.         no room, i said.         come, she said with her quizzical smile, surely,          chri,you underestimate the possibilities of the humbert home. we would put her in los room. i intended to make a guestroom of that hole anyway. its the coldest and meanest in the whole house.         what are you talking about i asked, the skin of my cheekbones tensing up this i take the trouble to note only because my daughters skin did the same when she felt that way disbelief, disgust, irritation.         are you bothered by romantic associations queried my wifein allusion to her first surrender.         hell no, said i. i just wonder where will you put your daughter when you get your guest or your maid.         ah, said mrs. humbert, dreaming, smiling, drawing out the ah simultaneously with the raise of one eyebrow and a soft exhalation of breath. little lo, im afraid, does not enter the picture at all, at all. little lo goes straight from camp to a good boarding school with strict discipline and some sound religious training. and thenbeardsley college. i have it all mapped out, you need not worry.         she went on to say that she, mrs. humbert, would have to overcome her habitual sloth and write to miss phallis sister who taught at st. algebra. the dazzling lake emerged. i said i had forgotten my sunglasses in the car and would catch up with her.         i had always thought that wringing ones hands was a fictional gesturethe obscure outcome, perhaps, of some medieval ritual but as i took to the woods, for a spell of despair and desperate meditation, this was the gesture look, lord, at these chains that would have come nearest to the mute expression of my mood.         had charlotte been valeria, i would have known how to handle the situation and handle is the word i want. in the good old days, by merely twisting fat valechkas brittle wrist the one she had fallen upon from a bicycle i could make her change her mind instantly but anything of the sort in regard to charlotte was unthinkable. bland american charlotte frightened me. my lighthearted dream of controlling her through her passion for me was all wrong. i dared not do anything to spoil the image of me she had set up to adore. i had toadied to her when she was the awesome duenna of my darling, and a groveling something still persisted in my attitude toward her. the only ace i held was her ignorance of my monstrous love for her lo. she had been annoyed by los liking me but          myfeelings she could not divine. to valeria i might have said look here, you fat fool,          cest moi qui dcidewhat is good for dolores humbert. to charlotte, i could not even say with ingratiating calm excuse me, my dear, i disagree. let us give the child one more chance. let me be her private tutor for a year or so. you once told me yourself in fact, i could not say anything at all to charlotte about the child without giving myself away. oh, you cannot imagine as i had never imagined what these women of principle are charlotte, who did not notice the falsity of all the everyday conventions and rules of behavior, and foods, and books, and people she doted upon, would distinguish at once a false intonation in anything i might say with a view to keeping lo near. she was like a musician who may be an odious vulgarian in ordinary life, devoid of tact and taste but who will hear a false note in music with diabolical accuracy of judgment. to break charlottes will, i would have to break her heart. if i broke her heart, her image of me would break too. if i said either i have my way with lolita, and you help me to keep the matter quiet, or we part at once, she would have turned as pale as a woman of clouded glass and slowly replied all right, whatever you add or retract, this is the end. and the end it would be.         such, then, was the mess. i remember reaching the parking area and pumping a handful of rusttasting water, and drinking it as avidly as if it would give me magic wisdom, youth, freedom, a tiny concubine. for a while, purplerobed, heeldangling, i sat on the edge of one of the rude tables, under the whooshing pines. in the middle distance, two little maidens in shorts and halters came out of a sundappled privy marked women. gumchewing mabel or mabels understudy laboriously, absentmindedly straddled a bicycle, and marion, shaking her hair because of the flies, settled behind, legs wide apart and wobbling, they slowly, absently, merged with the light and shade. lolita father and daughter melting into these woods the natural solution was to destroy mrs. humbert. but how         no man can bring about the perfect murder chance, however, can do it. there was the famous dispatch of a mme lacour in arles, southern france, at the close of last century. an unidentified bearded sixfooter, who, it was later conjectured, had been the ladys secret lover, walked up to her in a crowded street, soon after her marriage to colonel lacour, and mortally stabbed her in the back, three times, while the colonel, a small bulldog of a man, hung onto the murderers arm. by a miraculous and beautiful coincidence, right at the moment when the operator was in the act of loosening the angry little husbands jaws while several onlookers were closing in upon the group, a cranky italian in the house nearest to the scene set off by sheer accident some kind of explosive he was tinkering with, and immediately the street was turned into a pandemonium of smoke, falling bricks and running people. the explosion hurt no one except that it knocked out game colonel lacour but the ladys vengeful lover ran when the others ranand lived happily ever after.         now look what happens when the operator himself plans a perfect removal.         i walked down to hourglass lake. the spot from which we and a few other nice couples the farlows, the chatfields bathed was a kind of small cove my charlotte liked it because it was almost a private beach. the main bathing facilities or drowning facilities as the ramsdale          journalhad had occasion to say were in the left eastern part of the hourglass, and could not be seen from our covelet. to our right, the pines soon gave way to a curve of marshland which turned again into forest on the opposite side.         i sat down beside my wife so noiselessly that she started.         shall we go in she asked.         we shall in a minute. let me follow a train of thought.         i thought. more than a minute passed.         all right. come on.         was i on that train         you certainly were.         i hope so, said charlotte entering the water. it soon reached the gooseflesh of her thick thighs and then, joining her outstretched hands, shutting her mouth tight, very plainfaced in her black rubber headgear, charlotte flung herself forward with a great splash.         slowly we swam out into the shimmer of the lake.         on the opposite bank, at least a thousand paces away if one cold walk across water, i could make out the tiny figures of two men working like beavers on their stretch of shore. i knew exactly who they were a retired policeman of polish descent and the retired plumber who owned most of the timber on that side of the lake. and i also knew they were engaged in building, just for the dismal fun of the thing, a wharf. the knocks that reached us seemed so much bigger than what could be distinguished of those dwarfs arms and tools indeed, one suspected the director of those acrosonic effects to have been at odds with the puppetmaster, especially since the hefty crack of each diminutive blow lagged behind its visual version.         the short whitesand strip of our beachfrom which by now we had gone a little way to reach deep waterwas empty on weekday mornings. there was nobody around except those two tiny very busy figures on the opposite side, and a darkred private plane that droned overhead, and then disappeared in the blue. the setting was really perfect for a brisk bubbling murder, and here was the subtle point the man of law and the man of water were just near enough to witness an accident and just far enough not to observe a crime. they were near enough to hear a distracted bather thrashing about and bellowing for somebody to come and help him save his drowning wife and they were too far to distinguish if they happened to look too soon that the anything but distracted swimmer was finishing to tread his wife underfoot. i was not yet at that stage i merely want to convey the ease of the act, the nicety of the setting so there was charlotte swimming on with dutiful awkwardness she was a very mediocre mermaid, but not without a certain solemn pleasure for was not her merman by her side and as i watched, with the stark lucidity of a future recollection you knowtrying to see things as you will remember having seen them, the glossy whiteness of her wet face so little tanned despite all her endeavors, and her pale lips, and her naked convex forehead, and the tight black cap, and the plump wet neck, i knew that all i had to do was to drop back, take a deep breath, then grab her by the ankle and rapidly dive with my captive corpse. i say corpse because surprise, panic and inexperience would cause her to inhale at once a lethal gallon of lake, while i would be able to hold on for at least a full minute, openeyed under water. the fatal gesture passed like the tail of a falling star across the blackness of the contemplated crime. it was like some dreadful silent ballet, the male dancer holding the ballerina by her foot and streaking down through watery twilight. i might come up for a mouthful of air while still holding her down, and then would dive again as many times as would be necessary, and only when the curtain came down on her for good, would i permit myself to yell for help. and when some twenty minutes later the two puppets steadily growing arrived in a rowboat, one half newly painted, poor mrs. humbert humbert, the victim of a cramp or coronary occlusion, or both, would be standing on her head in the inky ooze, some thirty feet below the smiling surface of hourglass lake.         simple, was it not but what dye know, folksi just could not make myself do it         she swam beside me, a trustful and clumsy seal, and all the logic of passion screamed in my ear now is the time and, folks, i just couldnt in silence i turned shoreward and gravely, dutifully, she also turned, and still hell screamed its counsel, and still i could not make myself drown the poor, slippery, bigbodied creature. the scream grew more and more remote as i realized the melancholy fact that neither tomorrow, nor friday, nor any other day or night, could i make myself put her to death. oh, i could visualize myself slapping valerias breasts out of alignment, or otherwise hurting herand i could see myself, no less clearly, shooting her lover in the underbelly and making him say akh and sit down. but i could not kill charlotteespecially when things were on the whole not quite as hopeless, perhaps, as they seemed at first wince on that miserable morning. were i to catch her by her strong kicking foot were i to see her amazed look, hear her awful voice were i still to go through with the ordeal, her ghost would haunt me all my life. perhaps if the year were  instead of  i might have hoodwinked my gentle nature by administering her some classical poison from a hollow agate, some tender philter of death. but in our middleclass nosy era it would not have come off the way it used to in the brocaded palaces of the past. nowadays you have to be a scientist if you want to be a killer. no, no, i was neither. ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the majority of sex offenders that hanker for some throbbing, sweetmoaning, physical but not necessarily coital, relation with a girlchild, are innocuous, inadequate, passive, timid strangers who merely ask the community to allow them to pursue their practically harmless, socalled aberrant behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them. we are not sex fiends we do not rape as good soldiers do. we are unhappy, mild, dogeyed gentlemen, sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults, but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet. emphatically, no killers are we. poets never kill. oh, my poor charlotte, do not hate me in your eternal heaven among an eternal alchemy of asphalt and rubber and metal and stonebut thank god, not water, not water         nonetheless it was a very close shave, speaking quite objectively. and now comes the point of my perfectcrime parable.         we sat down on our towels in the thirsty sun. she looked around, loosened her bra, and turned over on her stomach to give her back a chance to be feasted upon. she said she loved me. she sighed deeply. she extended one arm and groped in the pocket of her robe for her cigarettes. she sat up and smoked. she examined her right shoulder. she kissed me heavily with open smoky mouth. suddenly, down the sand bank behind us, from under the bushes and pines, a stone rolled, then another.         those disgusting prying kids, said charlotte, holding up her big bra to her breast and turning prone again. i shall have to speak about that to peter krestovski.         from the debouchment of the trail came a rustle, a footfall, and jean farlow marched down with her easel and things.         you scared us, said charlotte.         jean said she had been up there, in a place of green concealment, spying on nature spies are generally shot, trying to finish a lakescape, but it was no good, she had no talent whatever which was quite trueand have          youever tried painting, humbert charlotte, who was a little jealous of jean, wanted to know if john was coming.         he was. he was coming home for lunch today. he had dropped her on the way to parkington and should be picking her up any time now. it was a grand morning. she always felt a traitor to cavall and melampus for leaving them roped on such gorgeous days. she sat down on the white sand between charlotte and me. she wore shorts. her long brown legs were about as attractive to me as those of a chestnut mare. she showed her gums when she smiled.         i almost put both of you into my lake, she said. i even noticed something you overlooked. you addressing humbert had your wrist watch on in, yes, sir, you had.         waterproof, said charlotte softly, making a fish mouth.         jean took my wrist upon her knee and examined charlottes gift, then put back humberts hand on the sand, palm up.         you could see anything that way, remarked charlotte coquettishly.         jean sighed. i once saw, she said, two children, male and female, at sunset, right here, making love. their shadows were giants. and i told you about mr. tomson at daybreak. next time i expect to see fat old ivor in the ivory. he is really a freak, that man. last time he told me a completely indecent story about his nephew. it appears         hullo there, said johns voice.                                             my habit of being silent when displeased or, more exactly, the cold and scaly quality of my displeased silence, used to frighten valeria out of her wits. she used to whimper and wail, saying           ce qui me rend folle, cest que je ne sais quoi tu penses quand tu es comme a. i tried being silent with charlotteand she just chirped on, or chucked my silence under the chin. an astonishing woman i would retire to my former room, now a regular studio, mumbling i had after all a learned opus to write, and cheerfully charlotte went on beautifying the home, warbling on the telephone and writing letters. from my window, through the lacquered shiver of poplar leaves, i could see her crossing the street and contentedly mailing her letter to miss phalens sister.         the week of scattered showers and shadows which elapsed after our last visit to the motionless sands of hourglass lake was one of the gloomiest i can recall. then came two or three dim rays of hopebefore the ultimate sunburst.         it occurred to me that i had a fine brain in beautiful working order and that i might as well use it. if i dared not meddle with my wifes plans for her daughter getting warmer and browner every day in the fair weather of hopeless distance, i could surely devise some general means to assert myself in a general way that might be later directed toward a particular occasion. one evening, charlotte herself provided me with an opening.         i have a surprise for you, she said looking at me with fond eyes over a spoonful of soup. in the fall we two are going to england.         i swallowed          myspoonful, wiped my lips with pink paper oh, the cool rich linens of mirana hotel and said         i have also a surprise for you, my dear. we two are not going to england.         why, whats the matter she said, lookingwith more surprise than i had counted uponat my hands i was involuntarily folding and tearing and crushing and tearing again the innocent pink napkin. my smiling face set her somewhat at ease, however.         the matter is quite simple, i replied. even in the most harmonious of households, as ours is, not all decisions are taken by the female partner. there are certain things that the husband is there to decide. i can well imagine the thrill that you, a healthy american gal, must experience at crossing the atlantic on the same ocean liner with lady bumbleor sam bumble, the frozen meat king, or a hollywood harlot. and i doubt not that you and i would make a pretty ad for the traveling agency when portrayed lookingyou, frankly starryeyed, i, controlling my envious admirationat the palace sentries, or scarlet guards, or beaver eaters, or whatever they are called. but i happen to be allergic to europe, including merry old england. as you well know, i have nothing but very sad associations with the old and rotting world. no colored ads in your magazines will change the situation.         my darling, said charlotte. i really         no, wait a minute. the present matter is only incidental. i am concerned with a general trend. when you wanted me to spend my afternoons sunbathing on the lake instead of doing my work, i gladly gave in and became a bronzed glamour boy for your sake, instead of remaining a scholar and, well, an educator. when you lead me to bridge and bourbon with the charming farlows, i meekly follow. no, please, wait. when you decorate your home, i do not interfere with your schemes. when you decidewhen you decide all kinds of matters, i may be in complete, or in partial, let us say, disagreementbut i say nothing. i ignore the particular. i cannot ignore the general. i love being bossed by you, but every game has its rules. i am not cross. i am not cross at all. dont do that. but i am one half of this household, and have a small but distinct voice.         she had come to my side and had fallen on her knees and was slowly, but very vehemently, shaking her head and clawing at my trousers. she said she had never realized. she said i was her ruler and her god. she said louise had gone, and let us make love right away. she said i must forgive her or she would die.         this little incident filled me with considerable elation. i told her quietly that it was a matter not of asking forgiveness, but of changing ones ways and i resolved to press my advantage and spend a good deal of time, aloof and moody, working at my bookor at least pretending to work.         the studio bed in my former room had long been converted into the sofa it had always been at heart, and charlotte had warned me since the very beginning of our cohabitation that gradually the room would be turned into a regular writers den. a couple of days after the british incident, i was sitting in a new and very comfortable easy chair, with a large volume in my lap, when charlotte rapped with her ring finger and sauntered in. how different were her movements from those of my lolita, when          sheused to visit me in her dear dirty blue jeans, smelling of orchards in nymphetland awkward and fey, and dimly depraved, the lower buttons of her shirt unfastened. let me tell you, however, something. behind the brashness of little haze, and the poise of big haze, a trickle of shy life ran that tasted the same, that murmured the same. a great french doctor once told my father that in near relatives the faintest gastric gurgle has the same voice.         so charlotte sauntered in. she felt all was not well between us. i had pretended to fall asleep the night before, and the night before that, as soon as we had gone to bed, and had risen at dawn.         tenderly, she inquired if she were not interrupting.         not at the moment, i said, turning volume c of the          girls encyclopediaaround to examine a picture printed bottomedge as printers say.         charlotte went up to a little table of imitation mahogany with a drawer. she put her hand upon it. the little table was ugly, no doubt, but it had done nothing to her.         i have always wanted to ask you, she said businesslike, not coquettish, why is this thing locked up do you want it in this room its so abominably uncouth.         leave it alone, i said. i was camping in scandinavia.         is there a key         hidden.         oh, hum         locked up love letters.         she gave me one of those woundeddoe looks that irritated me so much, and then, not quite knowing if i was serious, or how to keep up the conversation, stood for several slow pages campus, canada, candid camera, candy peering at the window pane rather than through it, drumming upon it with sharp almondandrose fingernails.         presently at canoeing or canvasback she strolled up to my chair and sank down, tweedily, weightily, on its arm, inundating me with the perfume my first wife had used. would his lordship like to spend the fall          here she asked, pointing with her little finger at an autumn view in a conservative eastern state. why very distinctly and slowly. she shrugged. probably harold used to take a vacation at that time. open season. conditional reflex on her part.         i think i know where that is, she said, still pointing. there is a hotel i remember, enchanted hunters, quaint, isnt it and the food is a dream. and nobody bothers anybody.         she rubbed her cheek against my temple. valeria soon got over that.         is there anything special you would like for dinner, dear john and jean will drop in later.         i answered with a grunt. she kissed me on my underlip, and, brightly saying she would bake a cake a tradition subsisted from my lodging days that i adored her cakes, left me to my idleness.         carefully putting down the open book where she had sat it attempted to send forth a rotation of waves, but an inserted pencil stopped the pages, i checked the hiding place of the key rather selfconsciously it lay under the old expensive safety razor i had used before she bought me a much better and cheaper one. was it the perfect hiding placethere, under the razor, in the groove of its velvetlined case the case lay in a small trunk where i kept various business papers. could i improve upon this remarkable how difficult it is to conceal thingsespecially when ones wife keeps monkeying with the furniture.                                             i think it was exactly a week after our last swim that the noon mail brought a reply from the second miss phalen. the lady wrote she had just returned to st. algebra from her sisters funeral. euphemia had never been the same after breaking that hip. as to the matter of mrs. humberts daughter, she wished to report that it was too late to enroll her this year but that she, the surviving phalen, was practically certain that if mr. and mrs. humbert brought dolores over in january, her admittance might be arranged.         next day, after lunch, i went to see our doctor, a friendly fellow whose perfect bedside manner and complete reliance on a few patented drugs adequately masked his ignorance of, and indifference to, medical science. the fact that lo would have to come back to ramsdale was a treasure of anticipation. for this event i wanted to be fully prepared. i had in fact begun my campaign earlier, before charlotte made that cruel decision of hers. i had to be sure when my lovely child arrived, that very night, and then night after night, until st. algebra took her away from me, i would possess the means of putting two creatures to sleep so thoroughly that neither sound nor touch should rouse them. throughout most of july i had been experimenting with various sleeping powders, trying them out on charlotte, a great taker of pills. the last dose i had given her she thought it was a tablet of mild bromidesto anoint her nerves had knocked her out for four solid hours. i had put the radio at full blast. i had blazed in her face an olisboslike flashlight. i had pushed her, pinched her, prodded herand nothing had disturbed the rhythm of her calm and powerful breathing. however, when i had done such a simple thing as kiss her, she had awakened at once, as fresh and strong as an octopus i barely escaped. this would not do, i thought had to get something still safer. at first, dr. byron did not seem to believe me when i said his last prescription was no match for my insomnia. he suggested i try again, and for a moment diverted my attention by showing me photographs of his family. he had a fascinating child of dollys age but i saw through his tricks and insisted he prescribe the mightiest pill extant. he suggested i play golf, but finally agreed to give me something that, he said, would really work and going to a cabinet, he produced a vial of violetblue capsules banded with dark purple at one end, which, he said, had just been placed on the market and were intended not for neurotics whom a draft of water could calm if properly administered, but only for great sleepless artists who had to die for a few hours in order to live for centuries. i love to fool doctors, and though inwardly rejoicing, pocketed the pills with a skeptical shrug. incidentally, i had had to be careful with him. once, in another connection, a stupid lapse on my part made me mention my last sanatorium, and i thought i saw the tips of his ears twitch. being not at all keen for charlotte or anybody else to know that period of my past, i had hastily explained that i had once done some research among the insane for a novel. but no matter the old rogue certainly had a sweet girleen.         i left in great spirits. steering my wifes car with one finger, i contentedly rolled homeward. ramsdale had, after all, lots of charm. the cicadas whirred the avenue had been freshly watered. smoothly, almost silkily, i turned down into our steep little street. everything was somehow so right that day. so blue and green. i knew the sun shone because my ignition key was reflected in the windshield and i knew it was exactly half past three because the nurse who came to massage miss opposite every afternoon was tripping down the narrow sidewalk in her white stockings and shoes. as usual, junks hysterical setter attacked me as i rolled downhill, and as usual, the local paper was lying on the porch where it had just been hurled by kenny.         the day before i had ended the regime of aloofness i had imposed upon myself, and now uttered a cheerful homecoming call as i opened the door of the living room. with her reamwhite nape and bronze bun to me, wearing the yellow blouse and maroon slacks she had on when i first met her, charlotte sat at the corner bureau writing a letter. my hand still on the doorknob, i repeated my hearty cry. her writing hand stopped. she sat still for a moment then she slowly turned in her chair and rested her elbow on its curved back. her face, disfigured by her emotion, was not a pretty sight as she stared at my legs and said         the haze woman, the big bitch, the old cat, the obnoxious mamma, thethe old stupid haze is no longer your dupe. she hasshe has         my fair accuser stopped, swallowing her venom and her tears. whatever humbert humbert saidor attempted to sayis inessential. she went on         youre a monster. youre a detestable, abominable, criminal fraud. if you come nearill scream out the window. get back         again, whatever h.h. murmured may be omitted, i think.         i am leaving tonight. this is all yours. only youll never, never see that miserable brat again. get out of this room.         reader, i did. i went up to the exsemistudio. arms akimbo, i stood for a moment quite still and selfcomposed, surveying from the threshold the raped little table with its open drawer, a key hanging from the lock, four other household keys on the table top. i walked across the landing into the humberts bedroom, and calmly removed my diary from under her pillow into my pocket. then i started to walk downstairs, but stopped halfway she was talking on the telephone which happened to be plugged just outside the door of the living room. i wanted to hear what she was saying she canceled an order for something or other, and returned to the parlor. i rearranged my respiration and went through the hallway to the kitchen. there, i opened a bottle of scotch. she could never resist scotch. then i walked into the dining room and from there, through the halfopen door, contemplated charlottes broad back.         you are ruining my life and yours, i said quietly. let us be civilized people. it is all your hallucination. you are crazy, charlotte. the notes you found were fragments of a novel. your name and hers were put in by mere chance. just because they came handy. think it over. i shall bring you a drink.         she neither answered nor turned, but went on writing in a scorching scrawl whatever she was writing. a third letter, presumably two in stamped envelopes were already laid out on the desk. i went back to the kitchen.         i set out two glasses to st. algebra to lo and opened the refrigerator. it roared at me viciously while i removed the ice from its heart. rewrite. let her read it again. she will not recall details. change, forge. write a fragment and show it to her or leave it lying around. why do faucets sometimes whine so horribly a horrible situation, really. the little pillowshaped blocks of icepillows for polar teddy bear, loemitted rasping, crackling, tortured sounds as the warm water loosened them in their cells. i bumped down the glasses side by side. i poured in the whiskey and a dram of soda. she had tabooed my pin. bark and bang went the icebox. carrying the glasses, i walked through the dining room and spoke through the parlor door which was a fraction ajar, not quite space enough for my elbow.         i have made you a drink, i said.         she did not answer, the mad bitch, and i placed the glasses on the sideboard near the telephone, which had started to ring.         leslie speaking. leslie tomson, said leslie tomson who favored a dip at dawn. mrs. humbert, sir, has been run over and youd better come quick.         i answered, perhaps a bit testily, that my wife was safe and sound, and still holding the receiver, i pushed open the door and said         theres this man saying youve been killed, charlotte.         but there was no charlotte in the living room.                                             i rushed out. the far side of our steep little street presented a peculiar sight. a big black glossy packard had climbed miss opposites sloping lawn at an angle from the sidewalk where a tartan laprobe had dropped in a heap, and stood there, shining in the sun, its doors open like wings, its front wheels deep in evergreen shrubbery. to the anatomical right of this car, on the trim turn of the lawnslope, an old gentleman with a white mustache, welldresseddoublebreasted gray suit, polkadotted bowtielay supine, his long legs together, like a deathsize wax figure. i have to put the impact of an instantaneous vision into a sequence of words their physical accumulation in the page impairs the actual flash, the sharp unity of impression rugheap, car, old mandoll, miss o.s nurse running with a rustle, a halfempty tumbler in her hand, back to the screened porchwhere the proppedup, imprisoned, decrepit lady herself may be imagined screeching, but not loud enough to drown the rhythmical yaps of the junk setter walking from group to groupfrom a bunch of neighbors already collected on the sidewalk, near the bit of checked stuff, and back to the car which he had finally run to earth, and then to another group on the lawn, consisting of leslie, two policemen and a sturdy man with tortoise shell glasses. at this point, i should explain that the prompt appearance of the patrolmen, hardly more than a minute after the accident, was due to their having been ticketing the illegally parked cars in a cross lane two blocks down the grade that the fellow with the glasses was frederick beale, jr., driver of the packard that his yearold father, whom the nurse had just watered on the green bank where he laya banked banker so to speakwas not in a dead faint, but was comfortably and methodically recovering from a mild heart attack or its possibility and, finally, that the laprobe on the sidewalk where she had so often pointed out to me with disapproval the crooked green cracks concealed the mangled remains of charlotte humbert who had been knocked down and dragged several feet by the beale car as she was hurrying across the street to drop three letters in the mailbox, at the corner of miss opposites lawn. these were picked up and handed to me by a pretty child in a dirty pink frock, and i got rid of them by clawing them to fragments in my trouser pocket.         three doctors and the farlows presently arrived on the scene and took over. the widower, a man of exceptional selfcontrol, neither wept nor raved. he staggered a bit, that he did but he opened his mouth only to impart such information or issue such directions as were strictly necessary in connection with the identification, examination and disposal of a dead woman, the top of her head a porridge of bone, brains, bronze hair and blood. the sun was still a blinding red when he was put to bed in dollys room by his two friends, gentle john and dewyeyed jean who, to be near, retired to the humberts bedroom for the night which, for all i know, they may not have spent as innocently as the solemnity of the occasion required.         i have no reason to dwell, in this very special memoir, on the prefuneral formalities that had to be attended to, or on the funeral itself, which was as quiet as the marriage had been. but a few incidents pertaining to those four or five days after charlottes simple death, have to be noted.         my first night of widowhood i was so drunk that i slept as soundly as the child who had slept in that bed. next morning i hastened to inspect the fragments of letters in my pocket. they had got too thoroughly mixed up to be sorted into three complete sets. i assumed that and you had better find it because i cannot buy came from a letter to lo and other fragments seemed to point to charlottes intention of fleeing with lo to parkington, or even back to pisky, lest the vulture snatch her precious lamb. other tatters and shreds never had i thought i had such strong talons obviously referred to an application not to st. a. but to another boarding school which was said to be so harsh and gray and gaunt in its methods although supplying croquet under the elms as to have earned the nickname of reformatory for young ladies. finally, the third epistle was obviously addressed to me. i made out such items as after a year of separation we may oh, my dearest, oh my worse than if it had been a woman you kept or, maybe, i shall die but on the whole my gleanings made little sense the various fragments of those three hasty missives were as jumbled in the palms of my hands as their elements had been in poor charlottes head.         that day john had to see a customer, and jean had to feed her dogs, and so i was to be deprived temporarily of my friends company. the dear people were afraid i might commit suicide if left alone, and since no other friends were available miss opposite was incommunicado, the mccoos were busy building a new house miles away, and the chatfields had been recently called to maine by some family trouble of their own, leslie and louise were commissioned to keep me company under the pretense of helping me to sort out and pack a multitude of orphaned things. in a moment of superb inspiration i showed the kind and credulous farlows we were waiting for leslie to come for his paid tryst with louise a little photograph of charlotte i had found among her affairs. from a boulder she smiled through blown hair. it had been taken in april , a memorable spring. while on a business visit to the states, i had had occasion to spend several months in pisky. we metand had a mad love affair. i was married, alas, and she was engaged to haze, but after i returned to europe, we corresponded through a friend, now dead. jean whispered she had heard some rumors and looked at the snapshot, and, still looking, handed it to john, and john removed his pipe and looked at lovely and fast charlotte becker, and handed it back to me. then they left for a few hours. happy louise was gurgling and scolding her swain in the basement.         hardly had the farlows gone than a bluechinned cleric calledand i tried to make the interview as brief as was consistent with neither hurting his feelings nor arousing his doubts. yes, i would devote all my life to the childs welfare. here, incidentally, was a little cross that charlotte becker had given me when we were both young. i had a female cousin, a respectable spinster in new york. there we would find a good private school for dolly. oh, what a crafty humbert         for the benefit of leslie and louise who might and did report it to john and jean i made a tremendously loud and beautifully enacted longdistance call and simulated a conversation with shirley holmes. when john and jean returned, i completely took them in by telling them, in a deliberately wild and confused mutter, that lo had gone with the intermediate group on a fiveday hike and could not be reached.         good lord, said jean, what shall we do         john said it was perfectly simplehe would get the climax police to find the hikersit would not take them an hour. in fact, he knew the country and         look, he continued, why don i drive there right now, and you may sleep with jeanhe did not really add that but jean supported his offer so passionately that it might be implied.         i broke down. i pleaded with john to let things remain the way they were. i said i could not bear to have the child all around me, sobbing, clinging to me, she was so highstrung, the experience might react on her future, psychiatrists have analyzed such cases. there was a sudden pause.         well, you are the doctor, said john a little bluntly. but after all i was charlottes friend and adviser. one would like to know what you are going to do about the child anyway.         john, cried jean, she is his child, not harold hazes. dont you understand humbert is dollys real father.         i see, said john. i am sorry. yes. i see. i did not realize that. it simplifies matters, of course. and whatever you feel is right.         the distraught father went on to say he would go and fetch his delicate daughter immediately after the funeral, and would do his best to give her a good time in totally different surroundings, perhaps a trip to new mexico or californiagranted, of course, he lived.         so artistically did i impersonate the calm of ultimate despair, the hush before some crazy outburst, that the perfect farlows removed me to their house. they had a good cellar, as cellars go in this country and that was helpful, for i feared insomnia and a ghost.         now i must explain          myreasons for keeping dolores away. naturally, at first, when charlotte had just been eliminated and i reentered the house a free father, and gulped down the two whiskeyandsodas i had prepared, and topped them with a pint or two of my pin, and went to the bathroom to get away from neighbors and friends, there was but one thing in my mind and pulsenamely, the awareness that a few hours hence, warm, brownhaired, and mine, mine, mine, lolita would be in my arms, shedding tears that i would kiss away faster than they could well. but as i stood wideeyed and flushed before the mirror, john farlow tenderly tapped to inquire if i was okayand i immediately realized it would be madness on my part to have her in the house with all those busybodies milling around and scheming to take her away from me. indeed, unpredictable lo herself mightwho knowsshow some foolish distrust of me, a sudden repugnance, vague fear and the likeand gone would be the magic prize at the very instant of triumph.         speaking of busybodies, i had another visitorfriend beale, the fellow who eliminated my wife. stodgy and solemn, looking like a kind of assistant executioner, with his bulldog jowls, small black eyes, thickly rimmed glasses and conspicuous nostrils, he was ushered in by john who then left us, closing the door upon us, with the utmost tact. suavely saying he had twins in my stepdaughters class, my grotesque visitor unrolled a large diagram he had made of the accident. it was, as my stepdaughter would have put it, a beaut, with all kinds of impressive arrows and dotted lines in varicolored inks. mrs. h.h.s trajectory was illustrated at several points by a series of those little outline figuresdolllike wee career girl or wacused in statistics as visual aids. very clearly and conclusively, this route came into contact with a boldly traced sinuous line representing two consecutive swervesone which the beale car made to avoid the junk dog dog not shown, and the second, a kind of exaggerated continuation of the first, meant to avert the tragedy. a very black cross indicated the spot where the trim little outline figure had at last come to rest on the sidewalk. i looked for some similar mark to denote the place on the embankment where my visitors huge wax father had reclined, but there was none. that gentleman, however, had signed the document as a witness underneath the name of leslie tomson, miss opposite and a few other people.         with his hummingbird pencil deftly and delicately flying from one point to another, frederick demonstrated his absolute innocence and the recklessness of my wife while he was in the act of avoiding the dog,          sheslipped on the freshly watered asphalt and plunged forward whereas she should have flung herself not forward but backward fred showed how by a jerk of his padded shoulder. i said it was certainly not his fault, and the inquest upheld my view.         breathing violently though jetblack tense nostrils, he shook his head and my hand then, with an air of perfect          savoir vivreand gentlemanly generosity, he offered to pay the funeralhome expenses. he expected me to refuse his offer. with a drunken sob of gratitude i accepted it. this took him aback. slowly, incredulously, he repeated what he had said. i thanked him again, even more profusely than before.         in result of that weird interview, the numbness of my soul was for a moment resolved. and no wonder i had actually seen the agent of fate. i had palpated the very flesh of fateand its padded shoulder. a brilliant and monstrous mutation had suddenly taken place, and here was the instrument. within the intricacies of the pattern hurrying housewife, slippery pavement, a pest of a dog, steep grade, big car, baboon at its wheel, i could dimly distinguish my own vile contribution. had i not been such a foolor such an intuitive geniusto preserve that journal, fluids produced by vindictive anger and hot shame would not have blinded charlotte in her dash to the mailbox. but even had they blinded her, still nothing might have happened, had not precise fate, that synchronizing phantom, mixed within its alembic the car and the dog and the sun and the shade and the wet and the weak and the strong and the stone. adieu, marlene fat fates formal handshake as reproduced by beale before leaving the room brought me out of my torpor and i wept. ladies and gentlemen of the juryi wept.                                             the elms and the poplars were turning their ruffled backs to a sudden onslaught of wind, and a black thunderhead loomed above ramsdales white church tower when i looked around me for the last time. for unknown adventures i was leaving the livid house where i had rented a room only ten weeks before. the shadesthrifty, practical bamboo shadeswere already down. on porches or in the house their rich textures lend modern drama. the house of heaven must seem pretty bare after that. a raindrop fell on my knuckles. i went back into the house for something or other while john was putting my bags into the car, and then a funny thing happened. i do not know if in these tragic notes i have sufficiently stressed the peculiar sending effect that the writers good lookspseudoceltic, attractively simian, boyishly manlyhad on women of every age and environment. of course, such announcements made in the first person may sound ridiculous. but every once in a while i have to remind the reader of my appearance much as a professional novelist, who has given a character of his some mannerism or a dog, has to go on producing that dog or that mannerism every time the character crops up in the course of the book. there may be more to it in the present case. my gloomy good looks should be kept in the minds eye if my story is to be properly understood. pubescent lo swooned to humberts charm as she did to hiccuppy music adult lotte loved me with a mature, possessive passion that i now deplore and respect more than i care to say. jean farlow, who was thirtyone and absolutely neurotic, had also apparently developed a strong liking for me. she was handsome in a carvedindian sort of way, with a burnt sienna complexion. her lips were like large crimson polyps, and when she emitted her special barking laugh, she showed large dull teeth and pale gums.         she was very tall, wore either slacks with sandals or billowing skirts with ballet slippers, drank any strong liquor in any amount, had had two miscarriages, wrote stories about animals, painted, as the reader knows, lakescapes, was already nursing the cancer that was to kill her at thirtythree, and was hopelessly unattractive to me. judge then of my alarm when a few seconds before i left she and i stood in the hallway jean, with her always trembling fingers, took me by the temples, and, tears in her bright blue eyes, attempted, unsuccessfully, to glue herself to my lips.         take care of yourself, she said, kiss your daughter for me.         a clap of thunder reverberated throughout the house, and she added         perhaps, somewhere, some day, at a less miserable time, we may see each other again jean, whatever, wherever you are, in minus timespace or plus soultime, forgive me all this, parenthesis included.         and presently i was shaking hands with both of them in the street, the sloping street, and everything was whirling and flying before the approaching white deluge, and a truck with a mattress from philadelphia was confidently rolling down to an empty house, and dust was running and writhing over the exact slab of stone where charlotte, when they lifted the laprobe for me, had been revealed, curled up, her eyes intact, their black lashes still wet, matted, like yours, lolita.                                             one might suppose that with all blocks removed and a prospect of delirious and unlimited delights before me, i would have mentally sunk back, heaving a sigh of delicious relief.          eh bine, pas du         tout         instead of basking in the beams of smiling chance, i was obsessed by all sorts of purely ethical doubts and fears. for instance might it not surprise people that lo was so consistently debarred from attending festive and funeral functions in her immediate family you rememberwe had not had her at our wedding. or another thing granted it was the long hairy arm of coincidence that had reached out to remove an innocent woman, might coincidence not ignore in a heathen moment what its twin lamb had done and hand lo a premature note of commiseration true, the accident had been reported only by the ramsdale          journalnot by the parkington          recorderor the climax          herald, camp q being in another state, and local deaths having no federal news interest but i could not help fancying that somehow dolly haze had been informed already, and that at the very time i was on my way to fetch her, she was being driven to ramsdale by friends unknown to me. still more disquieting than all these conjectures and worries, was the fact that humbert humbert, a brandnew american citizen of obscure european origin, had taken no steps toward becoming the legal guardian of his dead wifes daughter twelve years and seven months old. would i ever dare take those steps i could not repress a shiver whenever i imagined my nudity hemmed in by mysterious statutes in the merciless glare of the common law.         my scheme was a marvel of primitive art i would whizz over to camp q, tell lolita her mother was about to undergo a major operation at an invented hospital, and then keep moving with my sleepy nymphet from inn to inn while her mother got better and better and finally died. but as i traveled campward my anxiety grew. i could not bear to think i might not find lolita thereor find, instead, another, scared, lolita clamoring for some family friend not the farlows, thank godshe hardly knew thembut might there not be other people i had not reckoned with finally, i decided to make the longdistance call i had simulated so well a few days before. it was raining hard when i pulled up in a muddy suburb of parkington, just before the fork, one prong of which bypassed the city and led to the highway which crossed the hills to lake climax and camp q. i flipped off the ignition and for quite a minute sat in the car bracing myself for that telephone call, and staring at the rain, at the inundated sidewalk, at a hydrant a hideous thing, really, painted a thick silver and red, extending the red stumps of its arms to be varnished by the rain which like stylized blood dripped upon its argent chains. no wonder that stopping beside those nightmare cripples is taboo. i drove up to a gasoline station. a surprise awaited me when at last the coins had satisfactorily clanked down and a voice was allowed to answer mine.         holmes, the camp mistress, informed me that dolly had gone monday this was wednesday on a hike in the hills with her group and was expected to return rather late today. would i care to come tomorrow, and what was exactlywithout going into details, i said that her mother was hospitalized, that the situation was grave, that the child should not be told it was grave and that she should be ready to leave with me tomorrow afternoon. the two voices parted in an explosion of warmth and good will, and through some freak mechanical flaw all my coins came tumbling back to me with a hittingthejackpot clatter that almost made me laugh despite the disappointment at having to postpone bliss. one wonders if this sudden discharge, this spasmodic refund, was not correlated somehow, in the mind of mcfate, with my having invented that little expedition before ever learning of it as i did now.         what next i proceeded to the business center of parkington and devoted the whole afternoon the weather had cleared, the wet town was like silverandglass to buying beautiful things for lo. goodness, what crazy purchases were prompted by the poignant predilection humbert had in those days for check weaves, bright cottons, frills, puffedout short sleeves, soft pleats, snugfitting bodices and generously full skirts oh lolita, you are my girl, as vee was poes and bea dantes, and what little girl would not like to whirl in a circular skirt and scanties did i have something special in mind coaxing voices asked me. swimming suits we have them in all shades. dream pink, frosted aqua, glans mauve, tulip red, oolala black. what about paysuits slips no slips. lo and i loathed slips.         one of my guides in these matters was an anthropometric entry made by her mother on los twelfth birthday the reader remembers that knowyourchild book. i had the feeling that charlotte, moved by obscure motives of envy and dislike, had added an inch here, a pound there but since the nymphet had no doubt grown somewhat in the last seven months, i thought i could safely accept most of those january measurements hip girth, twentynine inches thigh girth just below the gluteal sulcus, seventeen calf girth and neck circumference, eleven chest circumference, twentyseven upper arm girth, eight waist, twentythree stature, fiftyseven inches weight, seventyeight pounds figure, linear intelligence quotient,  vermiform appendix present, thank god.         apart from measurements, i could of course visualize lolita with hallucinational lucidity and nursing as i did a tingle on my breastbone at the exact spot her silky top had come level once or twice with my heart and feeling as i did her warm weight in my lap so that, in a sense, i was always with lolita as a woman is with child, i was not surprised to discover later that my computation had been more or less correct. having moreover studied a midsummer sale book, it was with a very knowing air that i examined various pretty articles, sport shoes, sneakers, pumps of crushed kid for crushed kids. the painted girl in black who attended to all these poignant needs of mine turned parental scholarship and precise description into commercial euphemisms, such as           petite. another, much older woman, in a white dress, with a pancake makeup, seemed to be oddly impressed by my knowledge of junior fashions perhaps i had a midget for mistress so, when shown a skirt with cute pockets in front, i intentionally put a naive male question and was rewarded by a smiling demonstration of the way the zipper worked in the back of the skirt. i had next great fun with all kinds of shorts and briefsphantom little lolitas dancing, falling, daisying all over the counter. we rounded up the deal with some prim cotton pajamas in popular butcherboy style. humbert, the popular butcher.         there is a touch of the mythological and the enchanted in those large stores where according to ads a career girl can get a complete desktodate wardrobe, and where little sister can dream of the day when her wool jersey will make the boys in the back row of the classroom drool. lifesize plastic figures of snubbednosed children with duncolored, greenish, browndotted, faunish faces floated around me. i realized i was the only shopper in that rather eerie place where i moved about fishlike, in a glaucous aquarium. i sensed strange thoughts form in the minds of the languid ladies that escorted me from counter to counter, from rock ledge to seaweed, and the belts and the bracelets i chose seemed to fall from siren hands into transparent water. i bought an elegant valise, had my purchases put into it, and repaired to the nearest hotel, well pleased with my day.         somehow, in connection with that quiet poetical afternoon of fastidious shopping, i recalled the hotel or inn with the seductive name of the enchanted hunters with charlotte had happened to mention shortly before my liberation. with the help of a guidebook i located it in the secluded town of briceland, a fourhour drive from los camp. i could have telephoned but fearing my voice might go out of control and lapse into coy croaks of broken english, i decided to send a wire ordering a room with twin beds for the next night. what a comic, clumsy, wavering prince charming i was how some of my readers will laugh at me when i tell them the trouble i had with the wording of my telegram what should i put humbert and daughter humberg and small daughter homberg and immature girl homburg and child the droll mistakethe g at the endwhich eventually came through may have been a telepathic echo of these hesitations of mine.         and then, in the velvet of a summer night, my broodings over the philer i had with me oh miserly hamburg was he not a very enchanted hunter as he deliberated with himself over his boxful of magic ammunition to rout the monster of insomnia should he try himself one of those amethyst capsules there were forty of them, all toldforty nights with a frail little sleeper at my throbbing side could i rob myself of one such night in order to sleep certainly not much too precious was each tiny plum, each microscopic planetarium with its live startdust. oh, let me be mawkish for the nonce i am so tired of being cynical.                                             this daily headache in the opaque air of this tombal jail is disturbing, but i must persevere. have written more than a hundred pages and not got anywhere yet. my calendar is getting confused. that must have been around august , . dont think i can go on. heart, headeverything. lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita. repeat till the page is full, printer.                                             still in parkington. finally, i did achieve an hours slumberfrom which i was aroused by gratuitous and horribly exhausting congress with a small hairy hermaphrodite, a total stranger. by then it was six in the morning, and it suddenly occurred to me it might be a good thing to arrive at the camp earlier than i had said. from parkington i had still a hundred miles to go, and there would be more than that to the hazy hills and briceland. if i had said i would come for dolly in the afternoon, it was only because my fancy insisted on merciful night falling as soon as possible upon my impatience. but now i foresaw all kinds of misunderstandings and was all ajitter lest delay might give her the opportunity of some idle telephone call to ramsdale. however, when at . a.m. i attempted to start, i was confronted by a dead battery, and noon was nigh when at last i left parkington.         i reached my destination around half past two parked my car in a pine grove where a greenshirted, redheaded impish lad stood throwing horseshoes in sullen solitude was laconically directed by him to an office in a stucco cottage in a dying state, had to endure for several minutes the inquisitive commiseration of the camp mistress, a sluttish worn out female with rusty hair. dolly she said was all packed and ready to go. she knew her mother was sick but not critically. would mr. haze, i mean, mr. humbert, care to meet the camp counselors or look at the cabins where the girls live each dedicated to a disney creature or visit the lodge or should charlie be sent over to fetch her the girls were just finishing fixing the dining room for a dance. and perhaps afterwards she would say to somebody or other the poor guy looked like his own ghost.         let me retain for a moment that scene in all its trivial and fateful detail hag holmes writing out a receipt, scratching her head, pulling a drawer out of her desk, pouring change into my impatient palm, then neatly spreading a banknote over it with a bright and five photographs of girlchildren some gaudy moth or butterfly, still alive, safely pinned to the wall nature study the framed diploma of the camps dietitian my trembling hands a card produced by efficient holmes with a report of dolly hazes behavior for july fair to good keen on swimming and boating a sound of trees and birds, and my pounding heart i was standing with my back to the open door, and then i felt the blood rush to my head as i heart her respiration and voice behind me. she arrived dragging and bumping her heavy suitcase. hi she said, and stood still, looking at me with sly, glad eyes, her soft lips parted in a slightly foolish but wonderfully endearing smile.         she was thinner and taller, and for a second it seemed to me her face was less pretty than the mental imprint i had cherished for more than a month her cheeks looked hollowed and too much lentigo camouflaged her rosy rustic features and that first impression a very narrow human interval between two tiger heartbeats carried the clear implication that all widower humbert had to do, wanted to do, or would do, was to give this wanlooking though suncolored little orphan          au yeux battusand even those plumbaceous umbrae under her eyes bore freckles a sound education, a healthy and happy girlhood, a clean home, nice girlfriends of her age among whom if the fates deigned to repay me i might find, perhaps, a pretty little          magdleinfor herr doktor humbert alone. but in a wink, as the germans say, the angelic line of conduct was erased, and i overtook my prey time moves ahead of our fancies, and she was my lolita againin fact, more of my lolita than ever. i let my hand rest on her warm auburn head and took up her bag. she was all rose and honey, dressed in her brightest gingham, with a pattern of little red apples, and her arms and legs were of a deep golden brown, with scratches like tiny dotted lines of coagulated rubies, and the ribbed cuffs of her white socks were turned down at the remembered level, and because of her childish gait, or because i had memorized her as always wearing heelless shoes, her saddle oxfords looked somehow too large and too highheeled for her. goodbye, camp q, merry camp q. goodbye, plain unwholesome food, goodbye charlie boy. in the hot car she settled down beside me, slapped a prompt fly on her lovely knee then, her mouth working violently on a piece of chewing gum, she rapidly cranked down the window on her side and settled back again. we sped through the striped and speckled forest.         hows mother she asked dutifully.         i said the doctors did not quite know yet what the trouble was. anyway, something abdominal. abominable no, abdominal. we would have to hang around for a while. the hospital was in the country, near the gay town of lepingville, where a great poet had resided in the early nineteenth century and where we would take in all the shows. she thought it a peachy idea and wondered if we could make lepingville before nine p.m.         we should be at briceland by dinner time, i said, and tomorrow well visit lepingville. how was the hike did you have a marvelous time at the camp         uhhuh.         sorry to leave         unun.         talk, lodont grunt. tell me something.         what thing, dad she let the word expand with ironic deliberation.         any old thing.         okay, if i call you that eyes slit at the road.         quite.         its a sketch, you know. when did you fall for my mummy         some day, lo, you will understand many emotions and situations, such as for example the harmony, the beauty of spiritual relationship.         bah said the cynical nymphet.         shallow lull in the dialogue, filled with some landscape.         look, lo, at all those cows on that hillside.         i think ill vomit if i look at a cow again.         you know, i missed you terribly, lo.                   idid not. fact ive been revoltingly unfaithful to you, but it does not matter one bit, because youve stopped caring for me, anyway. you drive much faster than my mummy, mister.         i slowed down from a blind seventy to a purblind fifty.         why do you think i have ceased caring for you, lo         well, you havent kissed me yet, have you         inly dying, inly moaning, i glimpsed a reasonably wide shoulder of road ahead, and bumped and wobbled into the weeds. remember she is only a child, remember she is only         hardly had the car come to a standstill than lolita positively flowed into my arms. not daring, not daring let myself gonot even daring let myself realize that          thissweet wetness and trembling fire was the beginning of the ineffable life which, ably assisted by fate, i had finally willed into beingnot daring really kiss her, i touched her hot, opening lips with the utmost piety, tiny sips, nothing salacious but she, with an impatient wriggle, pressed her mouth to mine so hard that i felt her big front teeth and shared in the peppermint taste of her saliva. i knew, of course, it was but an innocent game on her part, a bit of backfisch foolery in imitation of some simulacrum of fake romance, and since as the psychotherapist, as well as the rapist, will tell you the limits and rules of such girlish games are fluid, or at least too childishly subtle for the senior partner to graspi was dreadfully afraid i might go too far and cause her to start back in revulsion and terror. and, as above all i was agonizingly anxious to smuggle her into the hermetic seclusion of the enchanged hunters, and we had still eighty miles to go, blessed intuition broke our embracea split second before a highway patrol car drew up alongside.         florid and beetlebrowed, its driver stared at me         happen to see a blue sedan, same make as yours, pass you before the junction         why, no.         we didnt, said lo, eagerly leaning across me, her innocent hand on my legs, but are you sure it was blue, because         the cop what shadow of us was he after gave the little colleen his best smile and went into a uturn.         we drove on.         the fruithead remarked lo. he should have nabbed          you.         why me for heavens sake         well, the speed in this bum state is fifty, andno, dont slow down, you, dull bulb. hes gone now.         we have still quite a stretch, i said, and i want to get there before dark. so be a good girl.         bad, bad girl, said lo comfortably. juvenile delickwent, but frank and fetching. that light was red. ive never seen such driving.         we rolled silently through a silent townlet.         say, wouldnt mother be absolutely mad if she found out we were lovers         good lord, lo, let us not talk that way.         but we          arelovers, arent we         not that i know of. i think we are going to have some more rain. dont you want to tell me of those little pranks of yours in camp         you talk like a book,          dad.         what have you been up to i insist you tell me.         are you easily shocked         no. go on.         let us turn into a secluded lane and ill tell you.         lo, i must seriously ask you not to play the fool. well         welli joined in all the activities that were offered.                   ensuite         ansooit, i was taught to live happily and richly with others and to develop a wholesome personality. be a cake, in fact.         yes. i saw something of the sort in the booklet.         we loved the sings around the fire in the big stone fireplace or under the darned stars, where every girl merged her own spirit of happiness with the voice of the group.         your memory is excellent, lo, but i must trouble you to leave out the swear words. anything else         the girl scouts motto, said lo rhapsodically, is also mine. i fill my life with worthwhile deeds such aswell, never mind what. my duty isto be useful. i am a friend to male animals. i obey orders. i am cheerful. that was another police car. i am thrifty and i am absolutely filthy in thought, word and deed.         now i do hope thats all, you witty child.         yep. thats all. nowait a sec. we baked in a reflector oven. isnt that terrific         well, thats better.         we washed zillions of dishes. zillions you know is schoolmarms slang for manymanymanymany. oh yes, last but not least, as mother saysnow let me seewhat was it i know we made shadowgraphs. gee, what fun.                   cest bien tout                   cest. except for one little thing, something i simply cant tell you without blushing all over.         will you tell it me later         if we sit in the dark and you let me whisper, i will. do you sleep in your old room or in a heap with mother         old room. your mother may have to undergo a very serious operation, lo.         stop at that candy bar, will you, said lo.         sitting on a high stool, a band of sunlight crossing her bare brown forearm, lolita was served an elaborate icecream concoction topped with synthetic syrup. it was erected and brought her by a pimply brute of a boy in a greasy bowtie who eyed my fragile child in her thin cotton frock with carnal deliberation. my impatience to reach briceland and the enchanted hunters was becoming more than i could endure. fortunately she dispatched the stuff with her usual alacrity.         how much cash do you have i asked.         not a cent, she said sadly, lifting her eyebrows, showing me the empty inside of her money purse.         this is a matter that will be mended in due time, i rejoined archly. are you coming         say, i wonder if they have a washroom.         you are not going there, i said firmly. it is sure to be a vile place. do come on.         she was on the whole an obedient little girl and i kissed her in the neck when we got back into the car.                   dontdo that, she said looking at me with unfeigned surprise. dont drool on me. you dirty man.         she rubbed the spot against her raised shoulder.         sorry, i murmured. im rather fond of you, thats all.         we drove under a gloomy sky, up a winding road, then down again.         well, im also sort of fond of you, said lolita in a delayed soft voice, with a sort of sigh, and sort of settled closer to me.         oh, my lolita, we shall never get there         dusk was beginning to saturate pretty little briceland, its phony colonial architecture, curiosity sops and imported shade trees, when we drove through the weakly lighted streets in search of the enchanted hunters. the air, despite a steady drizzle beading it, was warm and green, and a queue of people, mainly children and old men, had already formed before the box office of a movie house, dripping with jewelfires.         oh, i want to see that picture. lets go right after dinner. oh, lets         we might, chanted humbertknowing perfectly well, the sly tumescent devil, that by nine, when          hisshow began, she would be dead in his arms.         easy cried lo, lurching forward, as an accursed truck in front of us, its backside carbuncles pulsating, stopped at a crossing.         if we did not get to the hotel soon, immediately, miraculously, in the very next block, i felt i would lose all control over the haze jalopy with its ineffectual wipers and whimsical brakes but the passersby i applied to for directions were either strangers themselves or asked with a frown enchanted what as if i were a madman or else they went into such complicated explanations, with geometrical gestures, geographical generalities and strictly local clues then bear south after you hit the courthouse that i could not help losing my way in the maze of their wellmeaning gibberish. lo, whose lovely prismatic entrails had already digested the sweetmeat, was looking forward to a big meal and had begun to fidget. as to me, although i had long become used to a kind of secondary fate mcfates inept secretary, so to speak pettily interfering with the bosss generous magnificent planto grind and grope through the avenues of briceland was perhaps the most exasperating ordeal i had yet faced. in later months i could laugh at my inexperience when recalling the obstinate boyish way in which i had concentrated upon that particular inn with its fancy name for all along our route countless motor courts proclaimed their vacancy in neon lights, ready to accommodate salesmen, escaped convicts, impotents, family groups, as well as the most corrupt and vigorous couples. ah, gentle drivers gliding through summers black nights, what frolics, what twists of lust, you might see from your impeccable highways if kumfy kabins were suddenly drained of their pigments and became as transparent as boxes of glass         the miracle i hankered for did happen after all. a man and a girl, more or less conjoined in a dark car under dripping trees, told us we were in the heart of the park, but had only to turn left at the next traffic light and there we would be. we did not see any next traffic lightin fact, the park was as black as the sins it concealedbut soon after falling under the smooth spell of a nicely graded curve, the travelers became aware of a diamond glow through the mist, then a gleam of lakewater appearedand there it was, marvelously and inexorably, under spectral trees, at the top of a graveled drivethe pale palace of the enchanted hunters.         a row of parked cars, like pigs at a trough, seemed at first sight to forbid access but then, by magic, a formidable convertible, resplendent, rubious in the lighted rain, came into motionwas energetically backed out by a broadshouldered driverand we gratefully slipped into the gap it had left. i immediately regretted my haste for i noticed that my predecessor had now taken advantage of a garagelike shelter nearby where there was ample space for another car but i was too impatient to follow his example.         wow looks swank, remarked my vulgar darling squinting at the stucco as she crept out into the audible drizzle and with a childish hand tweaked loose the frockfold that had struck in the peachcleftto quote robert browning. under the arclights enlarged replicas of chestnut leaves plunged and played on white pillars. i unlocked the trunk compartment. a hunchbacked and hoary negro in a uniform of sorts took our bags and wheeled them slowly into the lobby. it was full of old ladies and clergy men. lolita sank down on her haunches to caress a palefaced, bluefreckled, blackeared cocker spaniel swooning on the floral carpet under her handas who would not, my heartwhile i cleared my throat through the throng to the desk. there a bald porcine old maneverybody was old in that old hotelexamined my features with a polite smile, then leisurely produced my garbled telegram, wrestled with some dark doubts, turned his head to look at the clock, and finally said he was very sorry, he had held the room with the twin beds till half past six, and now it was gone. a religious convention, he said, had clashed with a flower show in briceland, andthe name, i said coldly, is not humberg and not humbug, but herbert, i mean humbert, and any room will do, just put in a cot for my little daughter. she is ten and very tired.         the pink old fellow peered goodnaturedly at lostill squatting, listening in profile, lips parted, to what the dogs mistress, an ancient lady swathed in violet veils, was telling her from the depths of a cretonne easy chair.         whatever doubts the obscene fellow had, they were dispelled by that blossomlike vision. he said, he might still have a room, had one, in factwith a double bed. as to the cot         mr. potts, do we have any cots left potts, also pink and bald, with white hairs growing out of his ears and other holes, would see what could be done. he came and spoke while i unscrewed my fountain pen. impatient humbert         our double beds are really triple, potts cozily said tucking me and my kid in. one crowded night we had three ladies and a child like yours sleep together. i believe one of the ladies was a disguised man           mystatic. howeverwould there be a spare cot in , mr. swine         i think it went to the swoons, said swine, the initial old clown.         well manage somehow, i said. my wife may join us laterbut even then, i suppose, well manage.         the two pink pigs were now among my best friends. in the slow clear hand of crime i wrote dr. edgar h. humbert and daughter,  lawn street, ramsdale. a key  was halfshown to me magician showing object he is

wanted to load a question with violent significance.         ive asked them to put in a cot. which ill use if you like.         you are crazy, said lo.         why, my darling         because, my dahrling, when dahrling mother finds out shell divorce you and strangle me.         just dynamic. not really taking the matter too seriously.         now look here, i said, sitting down, while she stood, a few feet away from me, and stared at herself contentedly, not unpleasantly surprised at her own appearance, filling with her own rosy sunshine the surprised and pleased closetdoor mirror.         look here, lo. lets settle this once for all. for all practical purposes i am your father. i have a feeling of great tenderness for you. in your mothers absence i am responsible for your welfare. we are not rich, and while we travel, we shall be obligedwe shall be thrown a good deal together. two people sharing one room, inevitably enter into a kindhow shall i saya kind         the word is incest, said loand walked into the closet, walked out again with a young golden giggle, opened the adjoining door, and after carefully peering inside with her strange smoky eyes lest she make another mistake, retired to the bathroom.         i opened the window, tore off my sweatdrenched shirt, changed, checked the pill vial in my coat pocket, unlocked the         she drifted out. i tried to embrace her casually, a bit of controlled tenderness before dinner.         she said look, lets cut out the kissing game and get something to eat.         it was then that i sprang my surprise.         oh, what a dreamy pet she walked up to the open suitcase as if stalking it from afar, at a kind of slowmotion walk, peering at that distant treasure box on the luggage support. was there something wrong, i wondered, with those great gray eyes of hers, or were we both plunged in the same enchanted mist she stepped up to it, lifting her rather highheeled feet rather high, and bending her beautiful boyknees while she walked through dilating space with the lentor of one walking under water or in a flight dream. then she raised by the armlets a coppercolored, charming and quite expensive vest, very slowly stretching it between her silent hands as if she were a bemused birdhunter holding his breath over the incredible bird he spreads out by the tips of its flaming wings. then while i stood waiting for her she pulled out the slow snake of a brilliant belt and tried it on.         then she crept into my waiting arms, radiant, relaxed, caressing me with her tender, mysterious, impure, indifferent, twilight eyesfor all the world, like the cheapest of cheap cuties. for that is what nymphets imitatewhile we moan and die.         whats the katter with misses i muttered wordcontrol gone into her hair.         if you must know, she said, you do it the wrong way.         show, wight ray.         all in good time, responded the spoonerette.                  seva ascendes, pulsata, brulans, kizelans, dementissima.         elevator clatterans, pausa, clatterans, populus in corridoro.         hanc nisi         mors         mihi adimet nemo juncea puellula,         jo         pensavo fondissime, nobserva nihil quidquambut, of course, in another moment i might have committed some dreadful blunder fortunately, she returned to the treasure box.         from the bathroom, where it took me quite a time to shift back into normal gear for a humdrum purpose, i heard, standing, drumming, retaining my breath, my lolitas oos and gees of girlish delight.         she had used the soap only because it was sample soap.         well, come on, my dear, if you are as hungry as i am.         and so to the elevator, daughter swinging her old white purse, father walking in front nota bene never behind, she is not a lady. as we stood now side by side waiting to be taken down, she threw back her head, yawned without restraint and shook her curls.         when did they make you get up at that camp         halfpast she stifled another yawnsixyawn in full with a shiver of all her frame. halfpast, she repeated, her throat filling up again.         the dining room met us with a smell of fried fat and a faded smile. it was a spacious and pretentious place with maudlin murals depicting enchanted hunters in various postures and states of enchantment amid a medley of pallid animals, dryads and trees. a few scattered old ladies, two clergymen, and a man in a sports coat were finishing their meals in silence. the dining room closed at nine, and the greenclad, pokerfaced serving girls were, happily, in a desperate hurry to get rid of us.         does not he look exactly, but exactly, like quilty said lo in a soft voice, her sharp brown elbow not pointing, but visibly burning to point, at the lone diner in the loud checks, in the far corner of the room.         like our fat ramsdale dentist         lo arrested the mouthful of water she had just taken, and put down her dancing glass.         course not, she said with a splutter of mirth. i meant the writer fellow in the dromes ad.         oh, fame oh, femina         when the dessert was plunked downa huge wedge of cherry pie for the young lady and vanilla ice cream her protector, most of which she expeditiously added to her piei produced a small vial containing papas purple pills. as i look back at those seasick murals, at that strange and monstrous moment, i can only explain my behavior then by the mechanism of that dream vacuum wherein revolves a deranged mind but at the time, it all seemed quite simple and inevitable to me. i glanced around, satisfied myself that the last diner had left, removed the stopped, and with the utmost deliberation tipped the philter into my palm. i had carefully rehearsed before a mirror the gesture of clapping my empty hand to my open mouth and swallowing a fictitious pill. as i expected, she pounced upon the vial with its plump, beautifully colored capsules loaded with beautys sleep.         blue she exclaimed. violet blue. what are they made of         summer skies, i said, and plums and figs, and the grapeblood of emperors.         no, seriouslyplease.         oh, just purpills. vitamin x. makes one strong as an ox or an ax. want to try one         lolita stretched out her hand, nodding vigorously.         i had hoped the drug would work fast. it certainly did. she had had a long long day, she had gone rowing in the morning with barbara whose sister was waterfront director, as the adorable accessible nymphet now started to tell me in between suppressed palatehumping yawns, growing in volumeoh, how fast the magic potion workedand had been active in other ways too. the movie that had vaguely loomed in her mind was, of course, by the time we watertreaded out of the dining room, forgotten. as we stood in the elevator, she leaned against me, faintly smilingwouldnt you like me to tell youhalf closing her darklidded eyes. sleepy, huh said uncle tom who was bringing up the quiet francoirish gentleman and his daughter as well as two withered women, experts in roses. they looked with sympathy at my frail, tanned, tottering, dazed rosedarling. i had almost to carry her into our room. there, she sat down on the edge of the bed, swaying a little, speaking in dovedull, longdrawn tones.         if i tell youif i tell you, will you promise sleepy, so sleepyhead lolling, eyes going out, promise you wont make complaints         later, lo. now go to bed. ill leave you here, and you go to bed. give you ten minutes.         oh, ive been such a disgusting girl, she went on, shaking her hair, removing with slow fingers a velvet hair ribbon. lemme tell you         tomorrow, lo. go to bed, go to bedfor goodness sake, to bed.         i pocketed the key and walked downstairs.                                             gentlewomen of the jury bear with me allow me to take just a tiny bit of your precious time. so this was          le grand moment.i had left my lolita still sitting on the edge of the abysmal bed, drowsily raising her foot, fumbling at the shoelaces and showing as she did so the nether side of her thigh up to the crotch of her pantiesshe had always been singularly absentminded, or shameless, or both, in matters of legshow. this, then, was the hermetic vision of her which i had locked inafter satisfying myself that the door carried no inside bolt. the key, with its numbered dangler of carved wood, became forthwith the weighty sesame to a rapturous and formidable future. it was mine, it was part of my hot hairy fist. in a few minutessay, twenty, say halfanhour,          sicher its sicheras my uncle gustave used to sayi would let myself into that  and find my nymphet, my beauty and bride, imprisoned in her crystal sleep. jurors if my happiness could have talked, it would have filled that genteel hotel with a deafening roar. and my only regret today is that i did not quietly deposit key  at the office, and leave the town, the country, the continent, the hemisphere,indeed, the globethat very same night.         let me explain. i was not unduly disturbed by her selfaccusatory innuendoes. i was still firmly resolved to pursue my policy of sparing her purity by operating only in the stealth of night, only upon a completely anesthetized little nude. restraint and reverence were still my mottoeven if that purity incidentally, thoroughly debunked by modern science had been slightly damaged through some juvenile erotic experience, no doubt homosexual, at that accursed camp of hers. of course, in my oldfashioned, oldworld way, i, jeanjacques humbert, had taken for granted, when i first met her, that she was as unravished as the stereotypical notion of normal child had been since the lamented end of the ancient world b.c. and its fascinating practices. we are not surrounded in our enlighted era by little slave flowers that can be casually plucked between business and bath as they used to be in the days of the romans and we do not, as dignified orientals did in still more luxurious times, use tiny entertainers fore and aft between the mutton and the rose sherbet. the whole point is that the old link between the adult world and the child world has been completely severed nowadays by new customs and new laws. despite my having dabbled in psychiatry and social work, i really knew very little about children. after all, lolita was only twelve, and no matter what concessions i made to time and placeeven bearing in mind the crude behavior of american schoolchildreni still was under the impression that whatever went on among those brash brats, went on at a later age, and in a different environment. therefore to retrieve the thread of this explanation the moralist in me bypassed the issue by clinging to conventional notions of what twelveyearold girls should be. the child therapist in me a fake, as most of them arebut no matter regurgitated neofreudian hash and conjured up a dreaming and exaggerating dolly in the latency period of girlhood. finally, the sensualist in me a great and insane monster had no objection to some depravity in his prey. but somewhere behind the raging bliss, bewildered shadows conferredand not to have heeded them, this is what i regret human beings, attend i should have understood that lolita had          alreadyproved to be something quite different from innocent annabel, and that the nymphean evil breathing through every pore of the fey child that i had prepared for my secret delectation, would make the secrecy impossible, and the delectation lethal. i should have known by the signs made to me by something in lolitathe real child lolita or some haggard angel behind her back that nothing but pain and horror would result from the expected rapture. oh, winged gentlemen of the jury         and she was mine, she was mine, the key was in my fist, my fist was in my pocket, she was mine. in the course of evocations and schemes to which i had dedicated so many insomnias, i had gradually eliminated all the superfluous blur, and by stacking level upon level of translucent vision, had evolved a final picture. naked, except for one sock and her charm bracelet, spreadeagled on the bed where my philter had felled herso i foreglimpsed her a velvet hair ribbon was still clutched in her hand her honeybrown body, with the white negative image of a rudimentary swimsuit patterned against her tan, presented to me its pale breastbuds in the rosy lamplight, a little pubic floss glistened on its plump hillock. the cold key with its warm wooden addendum was in my pocket.         i wandered through various public rooms, glory below, gloom above for the look of lust always is gloomy lust is never quite sureeven when the velvety victim is locked up in ones dungeonthat some rival devil or influential god may still not abolish ones prepared triumph. in common parlance, i needed a drink but there was no barroom in that venerable place full of perspiring philistines and period objects.         i drifted to the mens room. there, a person in the clerical blacka hearty party          comme on ditchecking with the assistance of vienna, if it was still there, inquired of me how i had liked dr. boyds talk, and looked puzzled when i king sigmund the second said boyd was quite a boy. upon which, i neatly chucked the tissue paper i had been wiping my sensitive finger tips with into the receptacle provided for it, and sallied lobbyward. comfortably resting my elbows on the counter, i asked mr. potts was he quite sure my wife had not telephoned, and what about that cot he answered she had not she was dead, of course and the cot would be installed tomorrow if we decided to stay on. from a big crowded place called the hunters hall came a sound of many voices discussing horticulture or eternity. another room, called the raspberry room, all bathed in light, with bright little tables and a large one with refreshments, was still empty except for a hostess that type of worn woman with a glassy smile and charlottes manner of speaking she floated up to me to ask if i was mr. braddock, because if so, miss beard had been looking for me. what a name for a woman, i said and strolled away.         in and out of my heart flowed my rainbow blood. i would give her till halfpastnine. going back to the lobby, i found there a change a number of people in floral dresses or black cloth had formed little groups here and there, and some elfish chance offered me the sight of a delightful child of lolitas age, in lolitas type of frock, but pure white, and there was a white ribbon in her black hair. she was not pretty, but she was a nymphet, and her ivory pale legs and lily neck formed for one memorable moment a most pleasurable antiphony in terms of spinal music to my desire for lolita, brown and pink, flushed and fouled. the pale child noticed my gaze which was really quite casual and debonair, and being ridiculously selfconscious, lost countenance completely, rolling her eyes and putting the back of her hand to her cheek, and pulling at the hem of her skirt, and finally turning her thin mobile shoulder blades to me in specious chat with her cowlike mother.         i left the loud lobby and stood outside, on the white steps, looking at the hundreds of powdered bugs wheeling around the lamps in the soggy black night, full of ripple and stir. all i would doall i would dare dowould amount to such a trifle suddenly i was aware that in the darkness next to me there was somebody sitting in a chair on the pillared porch. i could not really see him but what gave him away was the rasp of a screwing off, then a discreet gurgle, then the final note of a placid screwing on. i was about to move away when his voice addressed me         where the devil did you get her         i beg your pardon         i said the weather is getting better.         seems so.         whos the lassie         my daughter.         you lieshes not.         i beg your pardon         i said july was hot. wheres her mother         dead.         i see. sorry. by the way, why dont you two lunch with me tomorrow. that dreadful crowd will be gone by then.         well be gone too. good night.         sorry. im pretty drunk. good night. that child of yours needs a lot of sleep. sleep is a rose, as the persians say. smoke         not now.         he struck a light, but because he was drunk, or because the wind was, the flame illumined not him but another person, a very old man, one of those permanent guests of old hotelsand his white rocker. nobody said anything and the darkness returned to its initial place. then i heard the oldtimer cough and deliver himself of some sepulchral mucus.         i left the porch. at least half an hour in all had elapsed. i ought to have asked for a sip. the strain was beginning to tell. if a violin string can ache, then i was that string. but it would have been unseemly to display any hurry. as i made my way through a constellation of fixed people in one corner of the lobby, there came a blinding flashand beaming dr. braddock, two orchidornamentalized matrons, the small girl in white, and presumably the bared teeth of humbert humbert sidling between the bridelike lassie and the enchanted cleric, were immortalizedinsofar as the texture and print of smalltown newspapers can be deemed immortal. a twittering group had gathered near the elevator. i again chose the stairs.  was near the fire escape. one could stillbut the key was already in the lock, and then i was in the room.                                             the door of the lighted bathroom stood ajar in addition to that, a skeleton glow came though the venetian blind from the outside arclights these intercrossed rays penetrated the darkness of the bedroom and revealed the following situation.         clothed in one of her old nightgowns, my lolita lay on her side with her back to me, in the middle of the bed. her lightly veiled body and bare limbs formed a z. she had put both pillows under her dark rousled head a band of pale light crossed her top vertebrae.         i seemed to have shed my clothes and slipped into pajamas with the kind of fantastic instantaneousness which is implied when in a cinematographic scene the process of changing is cut and i had already placed my knee on the edge of the bed when lolita turned her head and stared at me though the striped shadows.         now this was something the intruder had not expected. the whole pillspiel a rather sordid affair,          entre nous soit dit had had for object a fastness of sleep that a whole regiment would not have disturbed, and here she was staring at me, and thickly calling me barbara. barbara, wearing my pajamas which were much too tight for her, remained poised motionless over the little sleeptalker. softly, with a hopeless sigh, dolly turned away, resuming her initial position. for at least two minutes i waited and strained on the brink, like that tailor with his homemade parachute forty years ago when about to jump from the eiffel tower. her faint breathing had the rhythm of sleep. finally i heaved myself onto my narrow margin of bed, stealthily pulled at the odds and ends of sheets piled up to the south of my stonecold heelsand lolita lifted her head and gaped at me.         as i learned later from a helpful pharmaceutist, the purple pill did not even belong to the big and noble family of barbiturates, and though it might have induced sleep in a neurotic who believed it to be a potent drug, it was too mild a sedative to affect for any length of time a wary, albeit weary, nymphet. whether the ramsdale doctor was a charlatan or a shrewd old rogue, does not, and did not, really matter. what mattered, was that i had been deceived. when lolita opened her eyes again, i realized that whether or not the drug might work later in the night, the security i had relied upon was a sham one. slowly her head turned away and dropped onto her unfair amount of pillow. i lay quite still on my brink, peering at her rumpled hair, at the glimmer of nymphet flesh, where half a haunch and half a shoulder dimly showed, and trying to gauge the depth of her sleep by the rate of her respiration. some time passed, nothing changed, and i decided i might risk getting a little closer to that lovely and maddening glimmer but hardly had i moved into its warm purlieus than her breathing was suspended, and i had the odious feeling that little dolores was wide awake and would explode in screams if i touched her with any part of my wretchedness. please, reader no matter your exasperation with the tenderhearted, morbidly sensitive, infinitely circumspect hero of my book, do not skip these essential pages imagine me i shall not exist if you do not imagine me try to discern the doe in me, trembling in the forest of my own iniquity lets even smile a little. after all, there is no harm in smiling. for instance i almost wrote frinstance, i had no place to rest my head, and a fit of heartburn they call those fries french,          grand dieu was added to my discomfort.         she was again fast asleep, my nymphet, but still i did not dare to launch upon my enchanted voyage.          la petite dormeuse ou lamant ridicule. tomorrow i would stuff her with those earlier pills that had so thoroughly numbed her mummy. in the glove compartmentor in the gladstone bag should i wait a solid hour and then creep up again the science of nympholepsy is a precise science. actual contact would do it in one second flat. an interspace of a millimeter would do it in ten. let us wait.         there is nothing louder than an american hotel and, mind you, this was supposed to be a quiet, cozy, oldfashioned, homey placegracious living and all that stuff. the clatter of the elevators gatesome twenty yards northeast of my head but as clearly perceived as if it were inside my left templealternated with the banging and booming of the machines various evolutions and lasted well beyond midnight. every now and then, immediately east of my left ear always assuming i lay on my back, not daring to direct my viler side toward the nebulous haunch of my bedmate, the corridor would brim with cheerful, resonant and inept exclamations ending in a volley of goodnights. when          thatstopped, a toilet immediately north of my cerebellum took over. it was a manly, energetic, deepthroated toilet, and it was used many times. its gurgle and gush and long afterflow shook the wall behind me. then someone in a southern direction was extravagantly sick, almost coughing out his life with his liquor, and his toilet descended like a veritable niagara, immediately beyond our bathroom. and when finally all the waterfalls had stopped, and the enchanted hunters were sound asleep, the avenue under the window of my insomnia, to the west of my wakea staid, eminently residential, dignified alley of huge treesdegenerated into the despicable haunt of gigantic trucks roaring through the wet and windy night.         and less than six inches from me and my burning life, was nebulous lolita after a long stirless vigil, my tentacles moved towards her again, and this time the creak of the mattress did not awake her. i managed to bring my ravenous bulk so close to her that i felt the aura of her bare shoulder like a warm breath upon my cheek. and then, she sat up, gasped, muttered with insane rapidity something about boats, tugged at the sheets and lapsed back into her rich, dark, young unconsciousness. as she tossed, within that abundant flow of sleep, recently auburn, at present lunar, her arm struck me across the face. for a second i held her. she freed herself from the shadow of my embracedoing this not consciously, not violently, not with any personal distaste, but with the neutral plaintive murmur of a child demanding its natural rest. and again the situation remained the same lolita with her curved spine to humbert, humbert resting his head on his hand and burning with desire and dyspepsia.         the latter necessitated a trip to the bathroom for a draft of water which is the best medicine i know in my case, except perhaps milk with radishes and when i reentered the strange palestriped fastness where lolitas old and new clothes reclined in various attitudes of enchantment on pieces of furniture that seemed vaguely afloat, my impossible daughter sat up and in clear tones demanded a drink, too. she took the resilient and cold paper cup in her shadowy hand and gulped down its contents gratefully, her long eyelashes pointing cupward, and then, with an infantile gesture that carried more charm than any carnal caress, little lolita wiped her lips against my shoulder. she fell back on her pillow i had subtracted mine while she drank and was instantly asleep again.         i had not dared offer her a second helping of the drug, and had not abandoned hope that the first might still consolidate her sleep. i started to move toward her, ready for any disappointment, knowing i had better wait but incapable of waiting. my pillow smelled of her hair. i moved toward my glimmering darling, stopping or retreating every time i thought she stirred or was about to stir. a breeze from wonderland had begun to affect my thoughts, and now they seemed couched in italics, as if the surface reflecting them were wrinkled by the phantasm of that breeze. time and again my consciousness folded the wrong way, my shuffling body entered the sphere of sleep, shuffled out again, and once or twice i caught myself drifting into a melancholy snore. mists of tenderness enfolded mountains of longing. now and then it seemed to me that the enchanted prey was about to meet halfway the enchanted hunter, that her haunch was working its way toward me under the soft sand of a remote and fabulous beach and then her dimpled dimness would stir, and i would know she was farther away from me than ever.         if i dwell at some length on the tremors and groupings of that distant night, it is because i insist upon proving that i am not, and never was, and never could have been, a brutal scoundrel. the gentle and dreamy regions though which i crept were the patrimonies of poets          notcrimes prowling ground. had i reached my goal, my ecstasy would have been all softness, a case of internal combustion of which she would hardly have felt the heat, even if she were wide awake. but i still hoped she might gradually be engulfed in a completeness of stupor that would allow me to taste more than a glimmer of her. and so, in between tentative approximations, with a confusion of perception metamorphosing her into eyespots of moonlight or a fluffy flowering bush, i would dream i regained consciousness, dream i lay in wait.         in the first antemeridian hours there was a lull in the restless hotel night. then around four the corridor toilet cascaded and its door banged. a little after five a reverberating monologue began to arrive, in several installments, from some courtyard or parking place. it was not really a monologue, since the speaker stopped every few seconds to listen presumably to another fellow, but that other voice did not reach me, and so no real meaning could be derived from the part heard. its matteroffact intonations, however, helped to bring in the dawn, and the room was already suffused with lilac gray, when several industrious toilets went to work, one after the other, and the clattering and whining elevator began to rise and take down early risers and downers, and for some minutes i miserably dozed, and charlotte was a mermaid in a greenish tank, and somewhere in the passage dr. boyd said good morning to you in a fruity voice, and birds were busy in the trees, and then lolita yawned.         frigid gentlewomen of the jury i had thought that months, perhaps years, would elapse before i dared to reveal myself to dolores haze but by six she was wide awake, and by six fifteen we were technically lovers. i am going to tell you something very strange it was she who seduced me.         upon hearing her first morning yawn, i feigned handsome profiled sleep. i just did not know what to do. would she be shocked at finding me by her side, and not in some spare bed would she collect her clothes and lock herself up in the bathroom would she demand to be taken at once to ramsdaleto her mothers bedsideback to camp but my lo was a sportive lassie. i felt her eyes on me, and when she uttered at last that beloved chortling note of hers, i knew her eyes had been laughing. she rolled over to my side, and her warm brown hair came against my collarbone. i gave a mediocre imitation of waking up. we lay quietly. i gently caressed her hair, and we gently kissed. her kiss, to my delirious embarrassment, had some rather comical refinements of flutter and probe which made me conclude she had been coached at an early age by a little lesbian. no charlie boy could have taught her          that. as if to see whether i had my fill and learned the lesson, she drew away and surveyed me. her cheekbones were flushed, her full underlip glistened, my dissolution was near. all at once, with a burst of rough glee the sign of the nymphet, she put her mouth to my earbut for quite a while my mind could not separate into words the hot thunder of her whisper, and she laughed, and brushed the hair off her face, and tried again, and gradually the odd sense of living in a brand new, mad new dream world, where everything was permissible, came over me as i realized what she was suggesting. i answered i did not know what game she and charlie had played. you mean you have neverher features twisted into a stare of disgusted incredulity. you have never she started again. i took time out by nuzzling her a little. lay off, will you, she said with a twangy whine, hastily removing her brown shoulder from my lips. it was very curious the way she consideredand kept doing so for a long timeall caresses except kisses on the mouth or the stark act of love either romantic slosh or abnormal.         you mean, she persisted, now kneeling above me, you never did it when you were a kid         never, i answered quite truthfully.         okay, said lolita, here is where we start.         however, i shall not bore my learned readers with a detailed account of lolitas presumption. suffice it to say that not a trace of modesty did i perceive in this beautiful hardly formed young girl whom modern coeducation, juvenile mores, the campfire racket and so forth had utterly and hopelessly depraved. she saw the stark act merely as part of a youngsters furtive world, unknown to adults. what adults did for purposes of procreation was no business of hers. my life was handled by little lo in an energetic, matteroffact manner as if it were an insensate gadget unconnected with me. while eager to impress me with the world of tough kids, she was not quite prepared for certain discrepancies between a kids life and mine. pride alone prevented her from giving up for, in my strange predicament, i feigned supreme stupidity and had her have her wayat least while i could still bear it. but really these are irrelevant matters i am not concerned with socalled sex at all. anybody can imagine those elements of animality. a greater endeavor lures me on to fix once for all the perilous magic of nymphets.                                             i have to tread carefully. i have to speak in a whisper. oh you, veteran crime reporter, you grave old usher, you once popular policeman, now in solitary confinement after gracing that school crossing for years, you wretched emeritus read to by a boy it would never do, would it, to have you fellows fall madly in love with my lolita had i been a painter, had the management of the enchanted hunters lost its mind one summer day and commissioned me to redecorate their dining room with murals of my own making, this is what i might have thought up, let me list some fragments         there would have been a lake. there would have been an arbor in flameflower. there would have been nature studiesa tiger pursuing a bird of paradise, a choking snake sheathing whole the flayed trunk of a shoat. there would have been a sultan, his face expressing great agony belied, as it were, by his molding caress, helping a callypygean slave child to climb a column of onyx. there would have been those luminous globules of gonadal glow that travel up the opalescent sides of juke boxes. there would have been all kinds of camp activities on the part of the intermediate group, canoeing, coranting, combing curls in the lakeside sun. there would have been poplars, apples, a suburban sunday. there would have been a fire opal dissolving within a rippleringed pool, a last throb, a last dab of color, stinging red, smearing pink, a sigh, a wincing child.                                             i am trying to describe these things not to relive them in my present boundless misery, but to sort out the portion of hell and the portion of heaven in that strange, awful, maddening worldnymphet love. the beastly and beautiful merged at one point, and it is that borderline i would like to fix, and i feel i fail to do so utterly. why         the stipulation of the roman law, according to which a girl may marry at twelve, was adopted by the church, and is still preserved, rather tacitly, in some of the united states. and fifteen is lawful everywhere. there is nothing wrong, say both hemispheres, when a brute of forty, blessed by the local priest and bloated with drink, sheds his sweatdrenched finery and thrusts himself up to the hilt into his youthful bride. in such stimulating temperate climates says an old magazine in this prison library as st. louis, chicago and cincinnati, girls mature about the end of their twelfth year. dolores haze was born less than three hundred miles from stimulating cincinnati. i have but followed nature. i am natures faithful hound. why then this horror that i cannot shake off did i deprive her of her flower sensitive gentlewomen of the jury, i was not even her first lover.                                             she told me the way she had been debauched. we ate flavorless mealy bananas, bruised peaches and very palatable potato chips, and          die lleinetold me everything. her voluble but disjointed account was accompanied by many a droll          moue. as i think i have already observed, i especially remember one wry face on an ugh basis jellymouth distended sideways and eyes rolled up in a routine blend of comic disgust, resignation and tolerance for young frailty.         her astounding tale started with an introductory mention of her tentmate of the previous summer, at another camp, a very select one as she put it. that tentmate quite a derelict character, halfcrazy, but a swell kid instructed her in various manipulations. at first, loyal lo refused to tell me her name.         was it grace angel i asked.         she shook her head. no, it wasnt it was the daughter of a big shot. he         was it perhaps rose carmine         no, of course not. her father         was it, then, agnes sheridan perchance         she swallowed and shook her headand then did a double take.         say, how come you know all those kids         i explained.         well, she said. they are pretty bad, some of that school bunch, but not that bad. if you have to know, her name was elizabeth talbot, she goes now to a swanky private school, her father is an executive.         i recalled with a funny pang the frequency with which poor charlotte used to introduce into party chat such elegant tidbits as when my daughter was out hiking last year with the talbot girl.         i wanted to know if either mother learned of those sapphic diversions         gosh no, exhaled limp lo mimicking dread and relief, pressing a falsely fluttering hand to her chest.         i was more interested, however, in heterosexual experience. she had entered the sixth grade at eleven, soon after moving to ramsdale from the middle west. what did she mean by pretty bad         well, the miranda twins had shared the same bed for years, and donald scott, who was the dumbest boy in the school, had done it with hazel smith in his uncles garage, and kenneth knightwho was the brightestused to exhibit himself wherever and whenever he had a chance, and         let us switch to camp q, i said. and presently i got the whole story.         barbara burke, a sturdy blond, two years older than lo and by far the camps best swimmer, had a very special canoe which she shared with lo because i was the only other girl who could make willow island some swimming test, i imagine. through july, every morningmark, reader, every blessed morningbarbara and lo would be helped to carry the boat to onyx or eryx two small lakes in the wood by charlie holmes, the camp mistress son, aged thirteenand the only human male for a couple of miles around excepting an old meek stonedeaf handyman, and a farmer in an old ford who sometimes sold the campers eggs as farmers will every morning, oh my reader, the three children would take a short cut through the beautiful innocent forest brimming with all the emblems of youth, dew, birdsongs, and at one point, among the luxuriant undergrowth, lo would be left as sentinel, while barbara and the boy copulated behind a bush.         at first, lo had refused to try what it was like, but curiosity and camaraderie prevailed, and soon she and barbara were doing it by turns with the silent, coarse and surly but indefatigable charlie, who had as much sex appeal as a raw carrot but sported a fascinating collection of contraceptives which he used to fish out of a third nearby lake, a considerably larger and more populous one, called lake climax, after the booming young factory town of that name. although conceding it was sort of fun and fine for the complexion, lolita, i am glad to say, held charlies mind and manners in the greatest contempt. nor had her temperament been roused by that filthy fiend. in fact, i think he had rather stunned it, despite the fun.         by that time it was close to ten. with the ebb of lust, an ashen sense of awfulness, abetted by the realistic drabness of a gray neuralgic day, crept over me and hummed within my temples. brown, naked, frail lo, her narrow white buttocks to me, her sulky face to a door mirror, stood, arms akimbo, feet in new slippers with pussyfur tops wide apart, and through a forechanging lock tritely mugged at herself in the glass. from the corridor came the cooing voices of colored maids at work, and presently there was a mild attempt to open the door of our room. i had lo go to the bathroom and take a muchneeded soap shower. the bed was a frightful mess with overtones of potato chips. she tried on a twopiece navy wool, then a sleeveless blouse with a swirly clathrate skirt, but the first was too tight and the second too ample, and when i begged her to hurry up the situation was beginning to frighten me, lo viciously sent those nice presents of mine hurtling into a corner, and put on yesterdays dress. when she was ready at last, i gave her a lovely new purse of simulated calf in which i had slipped quite a few pennies and two mintbright dimes and told her to buy herself a magazine in the lobby.         ill be down in a minute, i said. and if i were you, my dear, i would not talk to strangers.         except for my poor little gifts, there was not much to pack but i was forced to devote a dangerous amount of time was she up to something downstairs to arranging the bed in such a way as to suggest the abandoned nest of a restless father and his tomboy daughter, instead of an exconvicts saturnalia with a couple of fat old whores. then i finished dressing and had the hoary bellboy come up for the bags.         everything was fine. there, in the lobby, she sat, deep in an overstuffed bloodred armchair, deep in a lurid movie magazine. a fellow of my age in tweeds the genre of the place had changed overnight to a spurious countrysquire atmosphere was staring at my lolita over his dead cigar and stale newspaper. she wore her professional white socks and saddle oxfords, and that bright print frock with the square throat a splash of jaded lamplight brought out the golden down on her warm brown limbs. there she sat, her legs carelessly highcrossed, and her pale eyes skimming along the lines with every now and then a blink. bills wife had worshipped him from afar long before they ever met in fact, she used to secretly admire the famous young actor as he ate sundaes in schwabs drugstore. nothing could have been more childish than her snubbed nose, freckled face or the purplish spot on her naked neck where a fairytale vampire had feasted, or the unconscious movement of her tongue exploring a touch of rosy rash around her swollen lips nothing could be more harmless than to read about jill, an energetic starlet who made her own clothes and was a student of serious literature nothing could be more innocent than the part in that glossy brown hair with that silky sheen on the temple nothing could be more naivebut what sickening envy the lecherous fellow whoever he wascome to think of it, he resembled a little my swiss uncle gustave, also a great admirer of          le dcouvertwould have experienced had he known that every nerve in me was still anointed and ringed with the feel of her bodythe body of some immortal demon disguised as a female child.         was pink pig mr. swoon absolutely sure my wife had not telephoned he was. if she did, would he tell her we had gone on to aunt clares place he would, indeedie. i settled the bill and roused lo from her chair. she read to the car. still reading, she was driven to a socalled coffee shop a few blocks south. oh, she ate all right. she even laid aside her magazine to eat, but a queer dullness had replaced her usual cheerfulness. i knew little lo could be very nasty, so i braced myself and grinned, and waited for a squall. i was unbathed, unshaven, and had had no bowel movement. my nerves were ajangle. i did not like the way my little mistress shrugged her shoulders and distended her nostrils when i attempted casual small talk. had phyllis been in the know before she joined her parents in maine i asked with a smile. look, said lo making a weeping grimace, let us get off the subject. i then triedalso unsuccessfully, no matter how i smacked my lipsto interest her in the road map. our destination was, let me remind my patient reader whose meek temper lo ought to have copied, the gay town of lepingville, somewhere near a hypothetical hospital. that destination was in itself a perfectly arbitrary one as, alas, so many were to be, and i shook in my shoes as i wondered how to keep the whole arrangement plausible, and what other plausible objectives to invent after we had taken in all the movies in lepingville. more and more uncomfortable did humbert feel. it was something quite special, that feeling an oppressive, hideous constraint as if i were sitting with the small ghost of somebody i had just killed.         as she was in the act of getting back into the car, an expression of pain flitted across los face. it flitted again, more meaningfully, as she settled down beside me. no doubt, she reproduced it that second time for my benefit. foolishly, i asked her what was the matter. nothing, you brute, she replied. you what i asked. she was silent. leaving briceland. loquacious lo was silent. cold spiders of panic crawled down my back. this was an orphan. this was a lone child, an absolute waif, with whom a heavylimbed, foulsmelling adult had had strenuous intercourse three times that very morning. whether or not the realization of a lifelong dream had surpassed all expectation, it had, in a sense, overshot its markand plunged into a nightmare. i had been careless, stupid, and ignoble. and let me be quite frank somewhere at the bottom of that dark turmoil i felt the writhing of desire again, so monstrous was my appetite for that miserable nymphet. mingled with the pangs of guilt was the agonizing through that her mood might prevent me from making love to her again as soon as i found a nice country road where to park in peace. in other words, poor humbert humbert was dreadfully unhappy, and while steadily and inanely driving toward lepingville, he kept racking his brains for some quip, under the bright wing of which he might dare turn to his seatmate. it was she, however, who broke the silence         oh, a squashed squirrel, she said. what a shame.         yes, isnt it eager, hopeful hum.         let us stop at the next gas station, lo continued. i want to go to the washroom.         we shall stop wherever you want, i said. and then as a lovely, lonely, supercilious grove oaks, i thought american trees at that stage were beyond me started to echo greenly the rush of our car, a red and ferny road on our right turned its head before slanting into the woodland, and i suggested we might perhaps         drive on, my lo cried shrilly.         righto. take it easy. down, poor beast, down.         i glanced at her. thank god, the child was smiling.         you chump, she said, sweetly smiling at me. you revolting creature. i was a daisyfresh girl, and look what youve done to me. i ought to call the police and tell them you raped me. oh, you dirty, dirty old man.         was she just joking an ominous hysterical note rang through her silly words. presently, making a sizzling sound with her lips, she started complaining of pains, said she could not sit, said i had torn something inside her. the sweat rolled down my neck, and we almost ran over some little animal or other that was crossing the road with tail erect, and again my viletempered companion called me an ugly name. when we stopped at the filling station, she scrambled out without a word and was a long time away. slowly, lovingly, an elderly friend with a broken nose wiped my windshieldthey do it differently at every place, from chamois cloth to soapy brush, this fellow used a pink sponge.         she appeared at last. look, she said in that neutral voice that hurt me so, give me some dimes and nickels. i want to call mother in that hospital. whats the number         get in, i said. you cant call that number.         why         get in and slam the door.         she got in and slammed the door. the old garage man beamed at her. i swung onto the highway.         why cant i call my mother if i want to         because, i answered, your mother is dead.                                             in the gay town of lepingville i bought her four books of comics, a box of candy, a box of sanitary pads, two cokes, a manicure set, a travel clock with a luminous dial, a ring with a real topaz, a tennis racket, roller skates with white high shoes, field glasses, a portable radio set, chewing gum, a transparent raincoat, sunglasses, some more garmentsswooners, shorts, all kinds of summer frocks. at the hotel we had separate rooms, but in the middle of the night she came sobbing into mine, and we made it up very gently. you see, she had absolutely nowhere else to go.                part two                                             it was then that began our extensive travels all over the states. to any other type of tourist accommodation i soon grew to prefer the functional motelclean, neat, safe nooks, ideal places for sleep, argument, reconciliation, insatiable illicit love. at first, in my dread of arousing suspicion, i would eagerly pay for both sections of one double unit, each containing a double bed. i wondered what type of foursome this arrangement was even intended for, since only a pharisaic parody of privacy could be attained by means of the incomplete partition dividing the cabin or room into two communicating love nests. by and by, the very possibilities that such honest promiscuity suggested two young couples merrily swapping mates or a child shamming sleep to earwitness primal sonorities made me bolder, and every now and then i would take a bedandcot or twinbed cabin, a prison cell or paradise, with yellow window shades pulled down to create a morning illusion of venice and sunshine when actually it was pennsylvania and rain.         we came to know          nous connmes,to use a flaubertian intonationthe stone cottages under enormous chateaubriandesque trees, the brick unit, the adobe unit, the stucco court, on what the tour book of the automobile association describes as shaded or spacious or landscaped grounds. the log kind, finished in knotty pine, reminded lo, by its goldenbrown glaze, of friendchicken bones. we held in contempt the plain whitewashed clapboard kabins, with their faint sewerish smell or some other gloomy selfconscious stench and nothing to boast of except good beds, and an unsmiling landlady always prepared to have her gift well, i could give you turned down.                  nous connmesthis is royal fun the wouldbe enticements of their repetitious namesall those sunset motels, ubeam cottages, hillcrest courts, pine view courts, mountain view courts, skyline courts, park plaza courts, green acres, macs courts. there was sometimes a special line in the writeup, such as children welcome, pets allowed           youare welcome,          youare allowed. the baths were mostly tiled showers, with an endless variety of spouting mechanisms, but with one definitely nonlaodicean characteristic in common, a propensity, while in use, to turn instantly beastly hot or blindingly cold upon you, depending on whether your neighbor turned on his cold or his hot to deprive you of a necessary complement in the shower you had so carefully blended. some motels had instructions pasted above the toilet on whose tank the towels were unhygienically heaped asking guests not to throw into its bowl garbage, beer cans, cartons, stillborn babies others had special notices under glass, such as things to do riding          you will often see riders coming down main street on their way back from a romantic moonlight ride.often at  a.m., sneered unromantic lo.                  nous connmesthe various types of motor court operators, the reformed criminal, the retired teacher and the business flop, among the males and the motherly, pseudoladylike and madamic variants among the females. and sometimes trains would cry in the monstrously hot and humid night with heartrending and ominous plangency, mingling power and hysteria in one desperate scream.         we avoided tourist homes, country cousins of funeral ones, oldfashioned, genteel and showerless, with elaborate dressing tables in depressingly whiteandpink little bedrooms, and photographs of the landladys children in all their instars. but i did surrender, now and then, to los predilection for real hotels. she would pick out in the book, while i petted her in the parked car in the silence of a duskmellowed, mysterious sideroad, some highly recommended lake lodge which offered all sorts of things magnified by the flashlight she moved over them, such as congenial company, betweenmeals snacks, outdoor barbecuesbut which in my mind conjured up odious visions of stinking high school boys in sweatshirts and an emberred cheek pressing against hers, while poor dr. humbert, embracing nothing but two masculine knees, would coldhumor his piles on the damp turf. most empty to her, too, were those colonial inns, which apart from gracious atmosphere and picture windows, promised unlimited quantities of mmm food. treasured recollections of my fathers palatial hotel sometimes led me to seek for its like in the strange country we traveled through. i was soon discouraged but lo kept following the scent of rich food ads, while i derived a not exclusively economic kick from such roadside signs as timber hotel,          children under  free.on the other hand, i shudder when recalling that          soidisanthighclass resort in a midwestern state, which advertised raidtheicebox midnight snacks and, intrigued by my accent, wanted to know my dead wifes and dead mothers maiden names. a twodays stay there cost me a hundred and twentyfour dollars and do you remember, miranda, that other ultrasmart robbers den with complimentary morning coffee and circulating ice water, and no children under sixteen no lolitas, of course         immediately upon arrival at one of the plainer motor courts which became our habitual haunts, she would set the electric fan awhirr, or induce me to drop a quarter into the radio, or she would read all the signs and inquire with a whine why she could not go riding up some advertised trail or swimming in that local pool of warm mineral water. most often, in the slouching, bored way she cultivated, lo would fall prostrate and abominably desirable into a red springchair or a green chaise longue, or a steamer chair of striped canvas with footrest and canopy, or a sling chair, or any other lawn chair under a garden umbrella on the patio, and it would take hours of blandishments, threats and promises to make her lend me for a few seconds her brown limbs in the seclusion of the fivedollar room before undertaking anything she might prefer to my poor joy.         a combination of navet and deception, of charm and vulgarity, of blue silks and rosy mirth, lolita, when she chose, could be a most exasperating brat. i was not really quite prepared for her fits of disorganized boredom, intense and vehement griping, her sprawling, droopy, dopeyeyed style, and what is called goofing offa kind of diffused clowning which she thought was tough in a boyish hoodlum way. mentally, i found her to be a disgustingly conventional little girl. sweet hot jazz, square dancing, gooey fudge sundaes, musicals, movie magazines and so forththese were the obvious items in her list of beloved things. the lord knows how many nickels i fed to the gorgeous music boxes that came with every meal we had i still hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her, people with names like sammy and jo and eddy and tony and peggy and guy and patty and rex, and sentimental song hits, all of them as similar to my ear as her various candies were to my palate. she believed, with a kind of celestial trust, any advertisement or advice that that appeared in          movie loveor          screen landstarasil starves pimples, or you better watch out if youre wearing your shirttails outside your jeans, gals, because jill says you shouldnt. if a roadside sign said visit our gift shopwe          hadto visit it,          hadto buy its indian curios, dolls, copper jewelry, cactus candy. the words novelties and souvenirs simply entranced her by their trochaic lilt. if some caf sign proclaimed icecold drinks, she was automatically stirred, although all drinks everywhere were icecold. she it was to whom ads were dedicated the ideal consumer, the subject and object of every foul poster. and she attemptedunsuccessfullyto patronize only those restaurants where the holy spirit of huncan dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottagecheesecrested salads.         in those days, neither she nor i had thought up yet the system of monetary bribes which was to work such havoc with my nerves and her morals somewhat later. i relied on three other methods to keep my pubescent concubine in submission and passable temper. a few years before, she had spent a rainy summer under miss phalens bleary eye in a dilapidated appalachian farmhouse that had belonged to some gnarled haze or other in the dead past. it still stood among its rank acres of golden rod on the edge of a flowerless forest, at the end of a permanently muddy road, twenty miles from the nearest hamlet. lo recalled that scarecrow of a house, the solitude, the soggy old pastures, the wind, the bloated wilderness, with an energy of disgust that distorted her mouth and fattened her halfrevealed tongue. and it was there that i warned her she would dwell with me in exile for months and years if need be, studying under me french and latin, unless her present attitude changed. charlotte, i began to understand you         a simple child, lo would scream no and frantically clutch at my driving hand whenever i put a stop to her tornadoes of temper by turning in the middle of a highway with the implication that i was about to take her straight to that dark and dismal abode. the farther, however, we traveled away from it west, the less tangible that menace became, and i had to adopt other methods of persuasion.         among these, the reformatory threat is the one i recall with the deepest moan of shame. from the very beginning of our concourse, i was clever enough to realize that i must secure her complete cooperation in keeping our relations secret, that it should become a second nature with her, no matter what grudge she might bear me, no matter what other pleasure she might seek.         come and kiss your old man, i would say, and drop that moody nonsense. in former times, when i was still your dream male the reader will notice what pains i took to speak los tongue, you swooned to records of the number one throbandsob idol of your coevals lo of my what speak english. that idol of your pals sounded, you thought, like friend humbert. but now, i am just your          old man, a dream dad protecting his dream daughter.         my          chre dolorsi want to protect you, dear, from all the horrors that happen to little girls in coal sheds and alley ways, and alas,          comme vous le savez trop bien, ma gentille, in the blueberry woods during the bluest of summers. through thick and thin i will still stay your guardian, and if you are good, i hope a court may legalize that guardianship before long. let us, however, forget, dolores haze, socalled legal terminology, terminology that accepts as rational the term lewd and lascivious cohabitation. i am not a criminal sexual psychopath taking indecent liberties with a child. the rapist was charlie holmes i am the therapista matter of nice spacing in the way of distinction. i am your daddum, lo. look, ive a learned book here about young girls. look, darling, what it says. i quote the normal girlnormal, mark youthe normal girl is usually extremely anxious to please her father. she feels in him the forerunner of the desired elusive male elusive is good, by polonius. the wise mother and your poor mother would have been wise, had she lived will encourage a companionship between father and daughter, realizingexcuse the corny stylethat the girl forms her ideals of romance and of men from her association with her father. now, what association does this cheery book meanand recommend i quote again among sicilians sexual relations between a father and his daughter are accepted as a matter of course, and the girl who participates in such relationship is not looked upon with disapproval by the society of which she is part. im a great admirer of sicilians, fine athletes, fine musicians, fine upright people, lo, and great lovers. but lets not digress. only the other day we read in the newspapers some bunkum about a middleaged morals offender who pleaded guilty to the violation of the mann act and to transporting a nineyearold girl across state lines for immoral purposes, whatever these are. dolores darling you are not nine but almost thirteen, and i would not advise you to consider yourself my crosscountry slave, and i deplore the mann act as lending itself to a dreadful pun, the revenge that the gods of semantics take against tightzippered philistines. i am your father, and i          amspeaking english, and i love you.         finally, let us see what happens if you, a minor, accused of having impaired the morals of an adult in a respectable inn, what happens if you complain to the police of my having kidnapped and raped you let us suppose they believe you. a minor female, who allows a person over twentyone to know her carnally, involves her victim into statutory rape, or seconddegree sodomy, depending on the technique and the maximum penalty is ten years. so, i go to jail. okay. i go to jail. but what happens to you, my orphan well, you are luckier. you become the ward of the department of public welfarewhich i am afraid sounds a little bleak. a nice grim matron of the miss phalen type, but more rigid and not a drinking woman, will take away your lipstick and fancy clothes. no more gadding about i dont know if you have ever heard of the laws relating to dependent, neglected, incorrigible and delinquent children. while i stand gripping the bars, you, happy neglected child, will be given a choice of various dwelling places, all more or less the same, the correctional school, the reformatory, the juvenile detention home, or one of those admirable girls protectories where you knit things, and sing hymns, and have rancid pancakes on sundays. you will go there, lolita          mylolita,          thislolita will leave plainer words, if we two are found out, you will be analyzed and institutionalized, my pet,          cest tout. you will dwell, my lolita will dwell come here, my brown flower with thirtynine other dopes in a dirty dormitory no, allow me, please under the supervision of hideous matrons. this is the situation, this is the choice. dont you think that under the circumstances dolores haze had better stick to her old man         by rubbing all this in, i succeeded in terrorizing lo, who despite a certain brash alertness of manner and spurts of wit was not as intelligent a child as her i.q. might suggest. but if i managed to establish that background of shared secrecy and shared guilt, i was much less successful in keeping her in good humor. every morning during our yearlong travels i had to devise some expectation, some special point in space and time for her to look forward to, for her to survive till bedtime. otherwise, deprived of a shaping and sustaining purpose, the skeleton of her day sagged and collapsed. the object in view might be anythinga lighthouse in virginia, a natural cave in arkansas converted to a caf, a collection of guns and violins somewhere in oklahoma, a replica of the grotto of lourdes in louisiana, shabby photographs of the bonanza mining period in the local museum of a rocky mountains resort, anything whatsoeverbut it had to be there, in front of us, like a fixed star, although as likely as not lo would feign gagging as soon as we got to it.         by putting the geography of the united states into motion, i did my best for hours on end to give her the impression of going places, of rolling on to some definite destination, to some unusual delight. i have never seen such smooth amiable roads as those that now radiated before us, across the crazy quilt of fortyeight states. voraciously we consumed those long highways, in rapt silence we glided over their glossy black dance floors. not only had lo no eye for scenery but she furiously resented my calling her attention to this or that enchanting detail of landscape which i myself learned to discern only after being exposed for quite a time to the delicate beauty ever present in the margin of our undeserving journey. by a paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland northamerican countryside had at first seemed to me something i accepted with a shock of amused recognition because of those painted oilclothes which were imported from america in the old days to be hung above washstands in centraleuropean nurseries, and which fascinated a drowsy child at bed time with the rustic green views they depictedopaque curly trees, a barn, cattle, a brook, the dull white of vague orchards in bloom, and perhaps a stone fence or hills of greenish gouache. but gradually the models of those elementary rusticities became stranger and stranger to the eye, the nearer i came to know them. beyond the tilled plain, beyond the toy roofs, there would be a slow suffusion of inutile loveliness, a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm, peeledpeach tinge pervading the upper edge of a twodimensional, dovegray cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist. there might be a line of spaced trees silhouetted against the horizon, and hot still noons above a wilderness of clover, and claude lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into misty azure with only their cumulus part conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background. or again, it might be a stern el greco horizon, pregnant with inky rain, and a passing glimpse of some mummynecked farmer, and all around alternating strips of quicksilverish water and harsh green corn, the whole arrangement opening like a fan, somewhere in kansas.         now and then, in the vastness of those plains, huge trees would advance toward us to cluster selfconsciously by the roadside and provide a bit of humanitarian shade above a picnic table, with sun flecks, flattened paper cups, samaras and discarded icecream sticks littering the brown ground. a great user of roadside facilities, my unfastidious lo would be charmed by toilet signsguysgals, johnjane, jackjill and even bucksdoes while lost in an artists dream, i would stare at the honest brightness of the gasoline paraphernalia against the splendid green of oaks, or at a distant hill scrambling outscarred but still untamedfrom the wilderness of agriculture that was trying to swallow it.         at night, tall trucks studded with colored lights, like dreadful giant christmas trees, loomed in the darkness and thundered by the belated little sedan. and again next day a thinly populated sky, losing its blue to the heat, would melt overhead, and lo would clamor for a drink, and her cheeks would hollow vigorously over the straw, and the car inside would be a furnace when we got in again, and the road shimmered ahead, with a remote car changing its shape miragelike in the surface glare, and seeming to hang for a moment, oldfashionedly square and high, in the hot haze. and as we pushed westward, patches of what the garageman called sage brush appeared, and then the mysterious outlines of tablelike hills, and then red bluffs inkblotted with junipers, and then a mountain range, dun grading into blue, and blue into dream, and the desert would meet us with a steady gale, dust, gray thorn bushes, and hideous bits of tissue paper mimicking pale flowers among the prickles of windtortured withered stalks all along the highway in the middle o which there sometimes stood simple cows, immobilized in a position tail left, white eyelashes right cutting across all human rules of traffic.         my lawyer has suggested i give a clear, frank account of the itinerary we followed, and i suppose i have reached here a point where i cannot avoid that chore. roughly, during that mad year august  to august , our route began with a series of wiggles and whorls in new england, then meandered south, up and down, east and west dipped deep into          ce quon appelledixieland, avoided florida because the farlows were there, veered west, zigzagged through corn belts and cotton belts this is not          tooclear i am afraid, clarence, but i did not keep any notes, and have at my disposal only an atrociously crippled tour book in three volumes, almost a symbol of my torn and tattered past, in which to check these recollections crossed and recrossed the rockies, straggled through southern deserts where we wintered reached the pacific, turned north through the pale lilac fluff of flowering shrubs along forest roads almost reached the canadian border and proceeded east, across good lands and bad lands, back to agriculture on a grand scale, avoiding, despite little los strident remonstrations, little los birthplace, in a corn, coal and hog producing area and finally returned to the fold of the east, petering out in the college town of beardsley.                                             now, in perusing what follows, the reader should bear in mind not only the general circuit as adumbrated above, with its many sidetrips and tourist traps, secondary circles and skittish deviations, but also the fact that far from being an indolent          partie de plaisir, our tour was a hard, twisted, teleological growth, whose sole          raison dtrethese french clichs are symptomatic was to keep my companion in passable humor from kiss to kiss.         thumbing through that battered tour book, i dimly evoke that magnolia garden in a southern state which cost me four bucks and which, according to the ad in the book, you must visit for three reasons because john galsworthy a stonedead writer of sorts acclaimed it as the worlds fairest garden because in  baedekers guide had marked it with a star and finally, because o, reader, my reader, guess because children and by jingo was not my lolita a child will walk starryeyed and reverently through this foretaste of heaven, drinking in beauty that can influence a life. not mine, said grim lo, and settled down on a bench with the fillings of two sunday papers in her lovely lap.         we passed and repassed through the whole gamut of american roadside restaurants, from the lowly eat with its deer head dark trace of long tear at inner canthus, humorous picture post cards of the posterior kurort type, impaled guest checks, life savers, sunglasses, adman visions of celestial sundaes, one half of a chocolate cake under glass, and several horribly experienced flies zigzagging over the sticky sugarpour on the ignoble counter and all the way to the expensive place with the subdued lights, preposterously poor table linen, inept waiters exconvicts or college boys, the roan back of a screen actress, the sable eyebrows of her male of the moment, and an orchestra of zootsuiters with trumpets.         we inspected the worlds largest stalagmite in a cave where three southeastern states have a family reunion admission by age adults one dollar, pubescents sixty cents. a granite obelisk commemorating the battle of blue licks, with old bones and indian pottery in the museum nearby, lo a dime, very reasonable. the present log cabin boldly simulating the past log cabin where lincoln was born. a boulder, with a plaque, in memory of the author of trees by now we are in poplar cove, n.c., reached by what my kind, tolerant, usually so restrained tour book angrily calls a very narrow road, poorly maintained, to which, though no kilmerite, i subscribe. from a hired motorboat operated by an elderly, but still repulsively handsome white russian, a baron they said los palms were damp, the little fool, who had known in california good old maximovich and valeria, we could distinguish the inaccessible millionaires colony on an island, somewhere off the georgia coast. we inspected further a collection of european hotel picture post cards in a museum devoted to hobbies at a mississippi resort, where with a hot wave of pride i discovered a colored photo of my fathers mirana, its striped awnings, its flag flying above the retouched palm trees. so what said lo, squinting at the bronzed owner of an expensive car who had followed us into the hobby house. relics of the cotton era. a forest in arkansas and, on her brown shoulder, a raised purplepink swelling the work of some gnat which i eased of its beautiful transparent poison between my long thumbnails and then sucked till i was gorged on her spicy blood. bourbon street in a town named new orleans whose sidewalks, said the tour book, may i liked the may

fronts of their flounced skirts with both little hands in that special way, and the devoted negress shaking her head on the upper landing. the menninger foundation, a psychiatric clinic, just for the heck of it. a patch of beautifully eroded clay and yucca blossoms, so pure, so waxy, but lousy with creeping white flies. independence, missouri, the starting point of the old oregon trail and

spring mountains with youngelephant lanugo along their spines endofthesummer mountains, all hunched up, their heavy egyptian limbs folded under folds of tawny motheaten plush oatmeal hills, flecked with green round oaks a last rufous mountain with a rich rug of lucerne at its foot.         moreover, we inspected little iceberg lake, somewhere in colorado, and the snow banks, and the cushionets of tiny alpine flowers, and more snow down which lo in redpeaked cap tried to slide, and squealed, and was snowballed by some youngsters, and retaliated in kind          comme on dit.skeletons of

high, in colorado at the corner of seventh street and central avenue in phoenix, arizona on third street, los angeles, because the tickets to some studio or other were sold out at a motel called

all its many subspecies and forms the modest soldier, spic and span, quietly waiting, quietly conscious of khakis viatric appeal the schoolboy wishing to go two blocks the killer wishing to go two thousand miles the mysterious, nervous, elderly gent, with brandnew suitcase and clipped mustache a trio of optimistic mexicans the college student displaying the grime of vacational outdoor work as proudly as the name of the famous college arching across the front of his sweatshirt the desperate lady whose battery has just died on her the cleancut, glossyhaired, shiftyeyed, whitefaced young beasts in loud shirts and coats, vigorously, almost priapically thrusting out tense thumbs to tempt lone women or sadsack salesmen with fancy cravings.         lets take him, lo would often plead, rubbing her knees together in a way she had, as some particularly disgusting          pollex, some man of my age and shoulder breadth, with the          face claquesof unemployed actor, walked backwards, practically in the path of our car.         oh, i had to keep a very sharp eye on lo, little limp lo owing perhaps to constant amorous exercise, she radiated, despite her very childish appearance, some special languorous glow which threw garage fellows, hotel pages, vacationists, goons in luxurious cars, maroon morons near blued pools, into fits of concupiscence which might have tickled my pride, had it not incensed my jealousy. for little lo was aware of that glow of hers, and i would often catch her          coulant un regardin the direction of some amiable male, some grease monkey, with a sinewy goldenbrown forearm and watchbraceleted wrist, and hardly had i turned my back to go and buy this very lo a lollipop, than i would hear her and the fair mechanic burst into a perfect love song of wisecracks.         when, during our longer stops, i would relax after a particularly violent morning in bed, and out of the goodness of my lulled heart allow herindulgent humto visit the rose garden or childrens library across the street with a motor court neighbors plain little mary and marys eightyearold brother, lo would come back an hour late, with barefoot mary trailing far behind, and the little boy metamorphosed into two gangling, goldenhaired high school uglies, all muscles and gonorrhea. the reader may well imagine what i answered my pet whenrather uncertainly, i admitshe would ask me if she could go with carl and al here to the rollerskating rink.         i remember the first time, a dusty windy afternoon, i did let her go to one such rink. cruelly she said it would be no fun if i accompanied her, since that time of day was reserved for teenagers. we wrangled out a compromise i remained in the car, among other empty cars with their noses to the canvastopped openair rink, where some fifty young people, many in pairs, were endlessly rolling round and round to mechanical music, and the wind silvered the trees. dolly wore blue jeans and white high shoes, as most of the other girls did. i kept counting the revolutions of the rolling crowdand suddenly she was missing. when she rolled past again, she was together with three hoodlums whom i had heard analyze a moment before the girl skaters from the outsideand jeer at a lovely leggy young thing who had arrived clad in red shorts instead of those jeans and slacks.         at inspection stations on highways entering arizona or california, a policemans cousin would peer with such intensity at us that my poor heart wobbled. any honey he would inquire, and every time my sweet fool giggled. i still have, vibrating all along my optic nerve, visions of lo on horseback, a link in the chain of a guided trip along a bridle trail lo bobbing at a walking pace, with an old woman rider in front and a lecherous rednecked duderancher behind and i behind him, hating his fat floweryshirted back even more fervently than a motorist does a slow truck on a mountain road. or else, at a ski lodge, i would see her floating away from me, celestial and solitary, in an ethereal chairlift, up and up, to a glittering summit where laughing athletes stripped to the waist were waiting for her, for her.         in whatever town we stopped i would inquire, in my polite european way, anent the whereabouts of natatoriums, museums, local schools, the number of children in the nearest school and so forth and at school bus time, smiling and twitching a little i discovered this          tic nerveuxbecause cruel lo was the first to mimic it, i would park at a strategic point, with my vagrant schoolgirl beside me in the car, to watch the children leave schoolalways a pretty sight. this sort of thing soon began to bore my so easily bored lolita, and, having a childish lack of sympathy for other peoples whims, she would insult me and my desire to have her caress me while blueeyed little brunettes in blue shorts, copperheads in green boleros, and blurred boyish blondes in faded slacks passed by in the sun.         as a sort of compromise, i freely advocated whenever and wherever possible the use of swimming pools with other girlchildren. she adored brilliant water and was a remarkably smart diver. comfortably robed, i would settle down in the rich postmeridian shade after my own demure dip, and there i would sit, with a dummy book or a bag of bonbons, or both, or nothing but my tingling glands, and watch her gambol, rubbercapped, bepearled, smoothly tanned, as glad as an ad, in her trimfitted satin pants and shirred bra. pubescent sweetheart how smugly would i marvel that she was mine, mine, mine, and revise the recent matitudinal swoon to the moan of the mourning doves, and devise the late afternoon one, and slitting my sunspeared eyes, compare lolita to whatever other nymphets parsimonious chance collected around her for my anthological delectation and judgment and today, putting my hand on my ailing heart, i really do not think that any of them ever surpassed her in desirability, or if they did, it was so two or three times at the most, in a certain light, with certain perfumes blended in the aironce in the hopeless case of a pale spanish child, the daughter of a heavyjawed nobleman, and another time          mais je divague.         naturally, i had to be always wary, fully realizing, in my lucid jealousy, the danger of those dazzling romps. i had only to turn away for a momentto walk, say, a few steps in order to see if our cabin was at last ready after the morning change of linenand lo and behold, upon returning, i would find the former,          les yeux perdus,dipping and kicking her longtoed feet in the water on the stone edge of which she lolled, while, on either side of her, there crouched a          brun adolescentwhom her russet beauty and the quicksilver in the baby folds of her stomach were sure to cause to          se tordreoh baudelairein recurrent dreams for months to come.         i tried to teach her to play tennis so we might have more amusements in common but although i had been a good player in my prime, i proved to be hopeless as a teacher and so, in california, i got her to take a number of very expensive lessons with a famous coach, a husky, wrinkled oldtimer, with a harem of ball boys he looked an awful wreck off the court, but now and then, when, in the course of a lesson, to keep up the exchange, he would put out as it were an exquisite spring blossom of a stroke and twang the ball back to his pupil, that divine delicacy of absolute power made me recall that, thirty years before, i had seen          himin cannes demolish the great gobbert until she began taking those lessons, i thought she would never learn the game. on this or that hotel court i would drill lo, and try to relive the days when in a hot gale, a daze of dust, and queer lassitude, i fed ball after ball to gay, innocent, elegant annabel gleam of bracelet, pleated white skirt, black velvet hair band. with every word of persistent advice i would only augment los sullen fury. to our games, oddly enough, she preferredat least, before we reached californiaformless pat ball approximationsmore ball hunting than actual playwith a wispy, weak, wonderfully pretty in an          ange gaucheway coeval. a helpful spectator, i would go up to that other child, and inhale her faint musky fragrance as i touched her forearm and held her knobby wrist, and push this way or that her cool thigh to show her the backhand stance. in the meantime, lo, bending forward, would let her sunnybrown curls hang forward as she stuck her racket, like a cripples stick, into the ground and emitted a tremendous ugh of disgust at my intrusion. i would leave them to their game and look on, comparing their bodies in motion, a silk scarf round my throat this was in south arizona, i thinkand the days had a lazy lining warmth, and awkward lo would slash at the ball and miss it, and curse, and send a simulacrum of a serve into the net, and show the wet glistening young down of her armpit as she brandished her racket in despair, and her even more insipid partner would dutifully rush out after every ball, and retrieve none but both were enjoying themselves beautifully, and in clear ringing tones kept the exact score of their ineptitudes all the time.         one day, i remember, i offered to bring them cold drinks from the hotel, and went up the gravel path, and came back with two tall glasses of pineapple juice, soda and ice and then a sudden void within my chest made me stop as i saw that the tennis court was deserted. i stooped to set down the glasses on a bench and for some reason, with a kind of icy vividness, saw charlottes face in death, and i glanced around, and noticed lo in white shorts receding through the speckled shadow of a garden path in the company of a tall man who carried two tennis rackets. i sprang after them, but as i was crashing through the shrubbery, i saw, in an alternate vision, as if lifes course constantly branched, lo, in slacks, and her companion, in shorts, trudging up and down a small weedy area, and beating bushes with their rackets in listless search for their last lost ball.         i itemize these sunny nothings mainly to prove to my judges that i did everything in my power to give my lolita a really good time. how charming it was to see her, a child herself, showing another child some of her few accomplishments, such as for example a special way of jumping rope. with her right hand holding her left arm behind her untanned back, the lesser nymphet, a diaphanous darling, would be all eyes, as the pavonine sun was all eyes on the gravel under the flowering trees, while in the midst of that oculate paradise, my freckled and raffish lass skipped, repeating the movements of so many others i had gloated over on the sunshot, watered, dampsmelling sidewalks and ramparts of ancient europe. presently, she would hand the rope back to her little spanish friend, and watch in her turn the repeated lesson, and brush away the hair from her brow, and fold her arms, and step on one toe with the other, or drop her hands loosely upon her still unflared hips, and i would satisfy myself that the damned staff had at last finished cleaning up our cottage whereupon, flashing a smile to the shy, darkhaired page girl of my princess and thrusting my fatherly fingers deep into los hair from behind, and then gently but firmly clasping them around the nape of her neck, i would lead my reluctant pet to our small home for a quick connection before dinner.         whose cat has scratched poor you a fullblown fleshy handsome woman of the repulsive type to which i was particularly attractive might ask me at the lodge, during a table dhote dinner followed by dancing promised to lo. this was one of the reasons why i tried to keep as far away from people as possible, while lo, on the other hand, would do her utmost to draw as many potential witnesses into her orbit as she could.         she would be, figuratively speaking wagging her tiny tail, her whole behind in fact as little bitches dowhile some grinning stranger accosted us and began a bright conversation with a comparative study of license plates. long way from home inquisitive parents, in order to pump lo about me, would suggest her going to a movie with their children. we had some close shaves. the waterfall nuisance pursued me of course in all our caravansaries. but i never realized how wafery their wall substance was until one evening, after i had loved too loudly, a neighbors masculine cough filled the pause as clearly as mine would have done and next morning as i was having breakfast at the milk bar lo was a late sleeper, and i liked to bring her a pot of hot coffee in bed, my neighbor of the eve, an elderly fool wearing plain glasses on his long virtuous nose and a convention badge on his lapel, somehow managed to rig up a conversation with me, in the course of which he inquired, if my missus was like his missus a rather reluctant getupper when not on the farm and had not the hideous danger i was skirting almost suffocated me, i might have enjoyed the odd look of surprise on his thinlipped weatherbeaten face when i drily answered, as i slithered off my stool, that i was thank god a widower.         how sweet it was to bring that coffee to her, and then deny it until she had done her morning duty. and i was such a thoughtful friend, such a passionate father, such a good pediatrician, attending to all the wants of my little auburn brunettes body my only grudge against nature was that i could not turn my lolita inside out and apply voracious lips to her young matrix, her unknown heart, her nacreous liver, the seagrapes of her lungs, her comely twin kidneys. on especially tropical afternoons, in the sticky closeness of the siesta, i liked the cool feel of armchair leather against my massive nakedness as i held her in my lap. there she would be, a typical kid picking her nose while engrossed in the lighter sections of a newspaper, as indifferent to my ecstasy as if it were something she had sat upon, a shoe, a doll, the handle of a tennis racket, and was too indolent to remove. her eyes would follow the adventures of her favorite strip characters there was one welldrawn sloppy bobbysoxer, with high cheekbones and angular gestures, that i was not above enjoying myself she studied the photographic results of headon collisions she never doubted the reality of place, time, and circumstance alleged to match the publicity pictures of nakedthighed beauties and she was curiously fascinated by the photographs of local brides, some in full wedding apparel, holding bouquets and wearing glasses.         a fly would settle and walk in the vicinity of her navel or explore her tender pale areolas. she tried to catch it in her fist charlottes method and then would turn to the column lets explore your mind.         lets explore your mind. would sex crimes be reduced if children obeyed a few donts dont play around public toilets. dont take candy or rides from strangers. if picked up, mark down the license of the car.         and the brand of the candy, i volunteered.         she went on, her cheek recedent against mine pursuant and this was a good day, mark, o reader         if you dont have a pencil, but are old enough to read         we, i quipquoted, medieval mariners, have placed in this bottle         if, she repeated, you dont have a pencil, but are old enough to read and writethis is what the guy means, isnt it, you dopescratch the number somehow on the roadside.         with your little claws, lolita.         she had entered my world, umber and black humberland, with rash curiosity she surveyed it with a shrug of amused distaste and it seemed to me now that she was ready to turn away from it with something akin to plain repulsion. never did she vibrate under my touch, and a strident what dyou think you are doing was all i got for my pains. to the wonderland i had to offer, my fool preferred the corniest movies, the most cloying fudge. to think that between a hamburger and a humburger, she wouldinvariably, with icy precisionplump for the former. there is nothing more atrociously cruel than an adored child. did i mention the name of that milk bar i visited a moment ago it was, of all things, the frigid queen. smiling a little sadly, i dubbed her my frigid princess. she did not see the wistful joke.         oh, d not scowl at me, reader, i do not intend to convey the impressin that i did not manage to be happy. readeer must understand that in the possession and thralldom of a nymphet the enchanted traveler stands, as it were,          beyond happiness.for there is no other bliss on earth comparable to that of fondling a nymphet. it is          hors         concours, that bliss, it belongs to another class, another plane of sensitivity. despite our tiffs, despite her nastiness, despite all the fuss and faces she made, and the vulgarity, and the danger, and the horrible hopelessness of it all, i still dwelled deep in my elected paradisea paradise whose skies were the color of hellflamesbut still a paradise.         the able psychiatrist who studies my caseand whom by now dr. humbert has plunged, i trust, into a state of leporine fascinationis no doubt anxious to have me take lolita to the seaside and have me find there, at last, the gratification of a lifetime urge, and release from the subconscious obsession of an incomplete childhood romance with the initial little miss lee.         well, comrade, let me tell you that i          didlook for a beach, though i also have to confess that by the time we reached its mirage of gray water, so many delights had already been granted me by my traveling companion that the search for a kingdom by the sea, a sublimated riviera, or whatnot, far from being the impulse of the subconscious, had become the rational pursuit of a purely theoretical thrill. the angels knew it, and arranged things accordingly. a visit to a plausible cove on the atlantic side was completely messed up by foul weather. a thick damp sky, muddy waves, a sense of boundless but somehow matteroffact mistwhat could be further removed from the crisp charm, the sapphire occasion and rosy contingency of my riviera romance a couple of semitropical beaches on the gulf, though bright enough, were starred and spattered by venomous beasties and swept by hurricane winds. finally, on a californian beach, facing the phantom of the pacific, i hit upon some rather perverse privacy in a kind of cave whence you could hear the shrikes of a lot of girl scouts taking their first surf bath on a separate part of the beach, behind rotting trees but the fog was like a wet blanket, and the sand was gritty and clammy, and lo was all gooseflesh and grit, and for the first time in my life i had as little desire for her as for a manatee. perhaps, my learned readers may perk up if i tell them that even had we discovered a piece of sympathetic seaside somewhere, it would have come too late, since my real liberation had occurred much earlier at the moment, in point of fact, when annabel haze, alias dolores lee, alias loleeta, had appeared tome, golden and brown, kneeling, looking up, on that shoddy veranda, in a kind of fictitious, dishonest, but eminently satisfactory seaside arrangement although there was nothing but a secondrate lake in the neighborhood..         so much for those special sensations, influence, if not actually brought about, by the tenets of modern psychiatry. consequently, i turned awayi headed my lolita awayfrom beaches which were either too bleak when lone, or too populous when ablaze. however, in recollection, i suppose, of my hopeless hauntings of public parks in europe, i was still keenly interested in outdoor activities and desirous of finding suitable playgrounds in the open where i had suffered such shameful privations. here, too, i was to be thwarted. the disappointment i must now register as i gently grade my story into an expression of the continuous risk and dread that ran through my bliss should in no wise reflect on the lyrical, epic, tragic buit never arcadian american wilds. they are beautiful, heartrendingly beautiful, those wilds, with a quality of wideeyed, unsung, innocent surrender that my lacquered, toybright swiss villages and exhaustively lauded alps no longer possess. innumerable lovers have clipped and kissed on the trim turf of oldwould mountainsides, on the innerspring moss, by a handy, hygienic rill, on rustic benches under the initialed oaks, and in so many          cabanesin so many beech forests. but in the wilds of america the openair lover will not find it easy to indulge in the most ancient of all crimes and pastimes. poisonous plants burn his sweethearts buttocks, nameless insects sting his sharp items of the forest floor prick his knees, insects hers and all around there abides a sustained rustle of potential snakes          que disje, of semiextinct dragonswhile the crablike seeds of ferocious flowers cling, in a hideous green crust, to gartered black sock and sloppy white sock alike.         i am exaggerating a little. one summer noon, just below timberline, where heavenlyhued blossoms that i would fain call larkspur crowded all along a purly moutain brook, we did find, lolita and i, a secluded romantic spot, a hundred feet or so above the pass where we had left our car. the slope seemed untrodden. a last panting pine was taking a wellearned breather on the rock it had reached. a marmot whistled at us and withdrew. beneath the laprobe i had spread fo lor, dryflowers crepitated softly. venus came and went. the jagged cliff crowning the upper talus and a tangle of shrugs growing below us seemed to offer us protection from sun and man alike. alas, i had not reckoned with a faint side trail that curled up in cagey fashion among the shrubs and rocks a few feet from us.         it was then that we came close to detection than ever before, and no wonder the experience curbed forever my yearning for rural amours.         i remember the operation was over, all over, and she was weeping in my armsa salutory storm of sobs after one of the fits of moodiness that had become so frequent with her in the course of that otherwise admirable year i had just retracted some silly promise she had forced me to make in a moment of blind impatient passion, and thee she was sprawling and sobbing, and pinching my caressing hand, and i was laughing happily, and the atrocious, unbelievable, unbearable, and, i suspect, eternal horror that i know          nowwas still but a dot of blackness in the blue of my bliss and so we lay, when with one of those jolts that have ended by knocking my poor heart out of its groove, i met the unblinking dark eyes of two strange and beautiful children, faunlet and nymphet, whom their identical flat dark hair and bloodless cheeks proclaimed siblings if not twins. they stood crouching and gaping at us, both in blue playsuits, blending with the mountain blossoms. i plucked at the laprobe for desperate concealmentand within the same instant, something that looked like a polkadotted pushball among the undergrowth a few paces away, went into a turning motion which was transformed into the gradually rising figure of a stout lady with a ravenblack bob, who automatically added a wild lily to her bouquet, while staring over her shoulder at us from behind her lovely carved bluestone children.         now that i have an altogether different mess on my conscience, i know that i am a courageous man, but in those days i was not aware of it, and i remember being surprised by my own coolness. with the quiet murmured order one gives a sweatstained distracted cringing trained animal even in the worst of plights what mad hope or hate makes the young beasts flanks pulsate, what black stars pierce the heart of the tamer, i made lo get up, and we decorously walked, and then indecorously scuttled down to the car. behind it a nifty station wagon was parked, and a handsome assyrian with q little blueblack beard,          un         monsieur trs bien, in silk shirt and magenta slacks, presumably the corpulent botanists husband, was gravely taking the picture of a signboard giving the altitude of the pass. it was well over , feet and i was quite out of breath and with a scrunch and a skid we drove off, lo still struggling with her clothes and swearing at me in language that i never dreamed little girls could know, let alone use.         there were other unpleasant incidents. there was the movie theatre once, for example. lo at the time still had for the cinema a veritable passion it was to decline into tepid condescension during her second high school year. we took in, voluptuously and indiscriminately, oh, i dont know, one hundred and fifty or two hundred programs during that one year, and during some of the denser periods of moviegoing we saw many of the newsreels up to halfadozen times since the same weekly one went with different main pictures and pursued us from town to town. her favorite kinds were, in this order musicals, underworlders, westerners. in the first, real singers and dancers had unreal stage careers in an essentially griefproof sphere of existence wherefrom death and truth were banned, and where, at the end, whitehaired, dewyeyed, technically deathless, the initially reluctant father of a showcrazy girl always finished by applauding her apotheosis on fabulous broadway. the underworld was a world apart there, heroic newspapermen were tortured, telephone bills ran to billions, and, in a robust atmosphere of incompetent marksmanship, villains were chased through sewers and storehouses by pathologically fearless cops i was to give them less exercise. finally there was the mahogany landscape, the floridfaced, blueeyed roughriders, the prim pretty schoolteacher arriving in roaring gulch, the rearing horse, the spectacular stampede, the pistol thrust through the shivered windowpane, the stupendous fist fight, the crashing mountain of dusty oldfashioned furniture, the table used as a weapon, the timely somersault, the pinned hand still groping for the dropped bowie knife, the grunt, the sweet crash of fist against chin, the kick in the belly, the flying tackle and immediately after a plethora of pain that would have hospitalized a hercules i should know by now, nothing to show but the rather becoming bruise on the bronzed cheek of the warmedup hero embracing his gorgeous frontier bride. i remember one matinee in a small airless theatre crammed with children and reeking with the hot breath of popcorn. the moon was yellow above the neckerchiefed crooner, and his finger was on his strumstring, and his foot was on a pine log, and i had innocently encircled los shoulder and approached my jawbone to her temple, when two harpies behind us started muttering the queerest thingsi do not know if i understood aright, but what i thought i did, made me withdraw my gentle hand, and of course the rest of the show was fog to me.         another jolt i remember is connected with a little burg we were traversing at night, during our return journey. some twenty miles earlier i had happened to tell her that the day school she would attend at beardsley was a rather highclass, noncoeducational one, with no modern nonsense, whereupon lo treated me to one of those furious harangues of hers where entreaty and insult, selfassertion and double talk, vicious vulgarity and childish despair, were interwoven in an exasperating semblance of logic which prompted a semblance of explanation from me. enmeshed in her wild words swell chance id be a sap if i took your opinion seriously stinker you cant boss me i despise you and so forth, i drove throuth the slumbering town at a fiftymileperhour pace in continuance of my smooth highway swoosh, and a twosome of patrolmen put their spotlight on the car, and told me to pull over. i shushed lo who was automatically raving on. the men peered at her and me with malevolent curiosity. suddenly all dimples, she beamed sweetly at them, as she never did at my orchideous masculinity for, in a sense, my lo was even more scared of the law than iand when the kind officers pardoned us and servilely we crawled on, her eyelids closed and fluttered as she mimicked limp prostration.         at this point i have a curious confession to make. you will laughbut really and truly i somehow never managed to find out quite exactly what the legal situation was. i do not know it yet. oh, i have learned a few odds and ends. alabama prohibits a guardian from changing the wards residence without an order of the court minnesota, to whom i take off my hat, provides that when a relative assumes permanent care and custody of any child under fourteen, the authority of a court does not come into play. query is the stepfather of a gaspingly adorable pubescent pet, a stepfather of only one months standing, a neurotic widower of mature years and small but independent means, with the parapets of europe, a divorce and a few madhouses behind him, is he to be considered a relative, and thus a natural guardian and if not, must i, and could i reasonably dare notify some welfare board and file a petition how do you file a petition, and have a courts agent investigate meek, fishy me and dangerous dolores haze the many books on marriage, rape, adoption and so on, that i guiltily consulted at the public libraries of big and small towns, told me nothing beyond darkly insinuating that the state is the superguardian of minor children. pilvin and zapel, if i remember their names right, in an impressive volume on the legal side of marriage, completely ignored stepfathers with motherless girls on their hands and knees. my best friend, a social service monographchicago, , which was dug out for me at great pains form a dusty storage recess by an innocent old spinster, said there is no principle that every minor must have a guardian the court is passive and enters the fray only when the childs situation becomes conspicuously perilous. a guardian, i concluded, was appointed only when he expressed his solemn and formal desire but months might elapse before he was given notice to appear at a hearing and grow his pair of gray wings, and in the meantime the fair demon child was legally left to her own devices which, after all, was the case of dolores haze. then came the hearing. a few questions from the bench, a few reassuring answers from the attorney, a smile, a nod, a light drizzle outside, and the appointment was made. and still i dared not. keep away, be a mouse, curl up in yourhole. courts became extravagantly active only when there was some monetary question involved two greedy guardians, a robbed orphan, a third, still greedier, party. but here all was in perfect order, and inventory had been made, and her mothers small property was waiting untouched for dolores haze to grow up. the best policy seemed to be to refrain from any application. or would some busybody, some humane society, butt in if i kept          tooquiet         friend farlow, who was a lawyer of sorts and ought to have been able to give me some solid advice, was too much occupied with jeans cancer to do anything more than what he had promisednamely, to look after chrlottes meager estate while i recovered very gradually from the shock of her death. i had conditioned him into believing dolores was my natural child, and so could not expect him to bother his head about the situation. i am, as the reader must have gathered by now, a poor businessman but neither ignorance nor indolence should have prevented me from seeking professional advice elsewhere. what stopped me ws the awful feeling that if i meddled with fate in any way and tried to rationalize her fantastic gift, that gift would be snatched away like that palace on the mountain top in the oriental tale which vanished whenever a prospective owner asked its custodian how come a strip of sunset sky was clearly visible from afar between black rock and foundation.         i decided that at beardsley the site of bearsley college for women i would have access to works of reference that i had not yet been able to study, such as woerners treatise on the american law of guardianship and certain united states childrens bureau publications. i also decided that anything was better for lo than the demoralizing idleness in which she lived. i could persuade her to do so many thingstheir list mnight stupefy a professional educator but no matter how i pleaded or stormed, i could never make her read any other book than the soclled comic books or stories in magazines for american females. any literature a peg higher smacked to her of school, and though theoretically willing to enjoy          a girl of the limberlostor the          arabian nights, or          little women, she was quite sure she would not fritter away her vacation on such highbrow reading matter.         i now think it was a great mistake to move east again and have her go to that private school in beardsley, instead of somehow scrambling across the mexican border while the scrambling was good so as to lie low for a couple of years in subtropical bliss until i could safely marry my little creole for i must confess that depending on the conditin of my glands and ganglia, i could switch in the course of the same day from one pole of insanity to the otherfrom the thought that around  i would have to get rid somehow of a difficult adolescent whose magic nymphage had evaporatedto the thought that with patience and lucki might have her produce eventually a nymphet with my blood in her exquisite veins, a lolita the second, who would be eight or nine around , when i would still be          dans la force de lge indeed, the telescopy of my mind, or unmind, was strong enough to distinguish in the remoteness of time a          vieillard encore vertor was it green rotbizarre, tender, salivating dr. humbert, practicing on supremely lovely lolita the third the art of being a granddad.         in the days of that wild journey of ours, i doubted not that as father to lolita the first i was a ridiculous failure. i did my best i read and reread a book with the unintentionally biblical title          know your own daughter, which i got at the same store where i bought lo, for her thirteenth birthday, a de luxe volume with commercially beautiful illustrations, of andersens          the little mermaid. but even at our very best moments, when we sat reading on a rainy day los glance skipping from the window to her wrist watch and back again, or had a quiet hearty meal in a crowded diner, or played a childish game of cards, or went shopping, or silently stared, with other motorists and their children, at some smashed, bloodbespattered car with a young womans shoe in the ditch lo, as we drove on that was the exact type of moccasin i was trying to describe to that jerk in the store on all those random occasions, i seemed to myself as implausible a father as she seemed to be a daughter. was, perhaps, guilty locomotion instrumental in vitiating our powers of impersonation would improvement be forthcoming with a fixed domicile and a routine schoolgirls day         in my choice of beardsley i was guided not only by the fact of there being a comparatively sedate school for girls located there, but also by the presence of the womens college. in my desire to get myself          cas,to attach myself somehow to some patterned surface which my stripes would blend with, i thought of a man i knew in the department of french at beardsley college he was good enough to use my textbook in his classes and had attempted to get me over once to deliver a lecture. i had no intention of doing so, since, as i have once remarked in the course of these confessions, there are few physiques i loathe more than the heavy lowslung pelvis, thick calves and deplorable complexion of the average coed in whom i see, maybe, the coffin of coarse female flesh within which my nymphets are buried alive but i did crave for a label, a background, and a simulacrum, and, as presently will become clear, there was a reason, a rather zany reason, why old gaston godins company would be particularly safe.         finally, there was the money question. my income was cracking under the strain of our joyride. true, i clung to the cheaper motor courts but every now and then, there would be a loud hotel de luxe, or a pretentious dude ranch, to mutilate our budget staggering sums, moreover, were expended on sightseeing and los clothes, and the old haze bus, although a still vigorous and very devoted machine, necessitated numerous minor and major repairs. in one of our strip maps that has happened to survive among the papers which the authorities have so kindly allowed me to use for the purpose of writing my statement, i find some jottings that help me compute the following. during that extravagant year , august to august, lodgings and food cost us arround , dollars gas, oil and repairs, ,, and various extras almost as much so that during about  days of actual motion we covered about , miles plus some  days of interpolated standstills, this modest          rentierspent around , dollars, or better say , because, unpractical as i am, i have surely forgotten a number of items.         and so we rolled east, i more devastated than braced with the satisfaction of my passion, and she glowing with health, her biiliac garland still as brief as a lads, although she had added two inches to her stature and eight pounds to her weight. we had been everywhere. we had really seen nothing. and i catch myself thinking that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely, trustful, dreamy, enormous country that by then, in retrospect, was no more to us than a collection of dogeared maps, ruined tour books, old tires, and her sobs in the nightevery night, every nightthe moment i feigned sleep.                                             when, through decorations of light and shade, we drove to  thayer street, a grave little lad met us with the keys and a note from gaston who had rented the house for us. my lo, without granting her new surroundings one glance, unseeingly turned on the radio to which instinct led her and lay down on the living room sofa with a batch of old magazines which in the same precise and blind manner she landed by dipping her hand into the nether anatomy of a lamp table.         i really did not mind where to dwell provided i could lock my lolita up somewhere but i had, i suppose, in the course of my correspondence with vague gaston, vaguely visualized a house of ivied brick. actually the place bore a dejected resemblance to the haze home a mere  distant it was the same sort of dull gray frame affair with a shingled roof and dull green drill awnings and the rooms, though smaller and furnished in a more consistent plushandplate style, were arranged in much the same order. my study turned out to be, however, a much larger room, lined from floor to ceiling with some two thousand books on chemistry which my landlord on sabbatical leave for the time being taught at beardsley college.         i had hoped beardsley school for girls, an expensive day school, with lunch thrown in and a glamorous gymnasium, would, while cultivating all those young bodies, provide some formal education for their minds as well. gaston godin, who was seldom right in his judgment of american habitus, had warned me that the institution might turn out to be one of those where girls are taught, as he put it with a foreigners love for such things not to spell very well, but to smell very well. i dont think they achieved even that.         at my first interview with headmistress pratt, she approved of my childs nice blue eyes blue lolita and of my own friendship with that french genius a genius gastonand then, having turned dolly over to a miss cormorant, she wrinkled her brow in a kind of          recueillementand said         we are not so much concerned, mr. humbird, with having our students become bookworms or be able to reel off all the capitals of europe which nobody knows anyway, or learn by heart the dates of forgotten battles. what we are concerned with is the adjustment of the child to group life. this is why we stress the four ds dramatics, dance, debating and dating. we are confronted by certain facts. your delightful dolly will presently enter an age groupwhere dates, dating, date dress, date book, date etiquette, mean as much to her as, say, business, business connections, business success, mean to you, or as much as smiling the happiness of my girls means to me. dorothy humbird is already involved in a whole system of social life which consists, whether we like ti or not, of hotdog stands, corner drugstores, malts and cokes, movies, squaredancing, blanket parties on beaches, and even hairfixing parties naturally at beardsley school we disapprove of some of these activities and we rechannel others into more constructive directions. but we do try to turn our backs on the fog and squarely face the sunshine. to put it briefly, while adopting certain teaching techniques, we are more interested in communication than in composition. that is, with due respect to shakespeare and others, we want our girls to          communicatefreely with the live world around them rather than plunge into musty old books. we are still groping perhaps, but we grope intelligently, like a gynecologist feeling a tumor. we thing, dr. humburg, in organissmal and organizational terms. we have done away with the mass or irrelevant topics that have traditionally been presented to young girls, leaving no place, in former days, for the knowledges and the skills, and the attitudes they will need in managing their lives andas the cynic might addthe lives of their husbands. mr. humberson, let us put it this way the position of a star is important, but the most practical spot for an icebox in the kitchen may be even more important to the budding housewife. you say that all you expect a child to obtain from school is a sound education. but what do we mean by education in the old days it was in the main a verbal phenomenon i mean, you could have a child learn by heart a good encyclopedia and he or she would know as much as or more than a school could offer. dr. hummer, do you realize that for the modern preadolescent child, medieval dates are of less vital value than weekend ones twinkleto repeat a pun that i heard the beardsley college psychoanalyst permit herself the other day. we live not only in a world of thughts, but also in a world of things. wrds without experience are meaningless. what on earth can dorothy hummerson care for greece and the orient with their harems and slaves         this program rather appalled me, but i spoke to two intelligent ladies who had been connected with the school, and they affirmed that the girls did quite a bit of sound reading and that the communication line was more or less ballyhoo aimed at giving oldfashioned beardsley school a financially remunerative modern touch, though actually it remained as prim as a prawn.         another reason attracting me to that particular school may sweem funny to some readers, but it was very important to me, for that is the way i am made. across our street, exactly in front of our house, there was, i noticed, a gap of weedy wasteland, with some colorful bushes and a pile of bricks and a few scattered planks, and the foam of shabby mauve and chrome autumn roadside flowers and through that gap you could see a shimmery section of school rd., running parallel to our thayer st., and immediately beyond that, the playground of the school apart from the psychological comfort this general arrangement should afford me by keeping dollys day adjacent to mine, i immediately foresaw the pleasure i would have in distinguishing from my studybedroom, by means of powerful binoculars, the statistically inevitable percentage of nymphets among the other girl children playing around dolly during recess unfortunately, on the very first day of school, workmen arrived and put up a fence some way down the gap, and in no time a construction of tawny wood maliciously arose beyond that fence utterly blocking my magic vista and as soon as they had erected a sufficient amount of material to spoil everything, those absurd builders suspended their work and never appeared again.                                             in a street called thayer street, in the residential green, fawn, and golden of a mellow academic townlet, one was bound to have a few amiable finedayers yelping at you. i prided myself on the exact temperature of my relations with them never rude, always aloof. my westdoor neighbor, who might have been a businessman or a college teacher, or both, would speak to me once in a while as he barbered some late garden blooms or watered his car, or, at a later date, defrosted his driveway i dont mind if these verbs are all wrong, but my brief grunts, just sufficeiently articulate to sound like conventional assents or interrogative pausefillers, precluded any evolution toward chumminess. of the two houses flanking the bit of scrubby waste opposite, one was closed, and the other contained two professors of english, tweedy and shorthaired miss lester and fadedly feminine miss fabian, whose only subject of brief sidewalk conversation with me was god bless their tact the young loveliness of my daughter and the nave charm of gaston godin. my eastdoor neighbor was by far the most dangerous one, a sharpnosed stock character whose late brother had been attached to the college as superintendent of buildings and grounds. i remember her waylaying dolly, while i stood at the living room window, feverishly awaiting my darlings return from school. the odious spinster, trying to conceal her morbid inquisitiveness under a mask of dulcet goodwill, stood leaning on her slim umbrella the sleet had just stopped, a cold wet sun had sidled out, and dolly, her brown coat open despite the raw weather, her structural heap of books pressed against her stomach, her knees showing pink above her clumsy wellingtons, a sheepish frightened slittle smile flitting over and off her snubnosed face, whichowing perhaps to the pale wintry lightlooked almost plain, in a rustic, german,          mgdleinlike way, as she stood there and dealt with miss easts questions and where is your mother, my dear and what is your poor fathers occupation and where did you love before another time the loathsome creature accosted me with a welcoming whinebut i evaded her and a few days later there came from her a note in a bluemargined envelope, a nice mixture of poison and treacle, suggesting dolly come over on a sunday and curl up in a chair to look through the loads of beautiful books my dear mother gave me when i was a child, instead of having the radio on at full blast till all hours of the night.         i had also to be careful in regard to a mrs. holigan, a charwoman and cook of sorts whom i had inherited with the vacuum cleaner from the previous tenants. dolly got lunch at school, so that this was no trouble, and i had become adept at providing her with a big breakfast and warming up the dinner that mrs. holigan prepared before leaving. that kindly and harmless woman had, thank god, a rather bleary eye that missed details, and i had become a great expert in bedmaking but still i was continuously obsessed by the feeling that some fatal stain had been left somewhere, or that, on the rare occasions where holigans presence happened to coincide with los, simple lo might succumb to buxom sympathy in the course of a cozy kitchen chat. i often felt we lived in a lighted house of glass, and any moment some thinlipped parchment face would peer through a carelessly unshaded window to obtain a free glimpse of things that the most jaded          voyeurwould have paid a small fortune to watch.                                             a word about gaston godin. the main reason why i enjoyedor at least tolerated with reliefhis company was the spell of absolute security that his ample person cast on my secret. not that he knew it i had no special reason to confide in him, and he was much too selfcentered and abstract to notice or suspect anything that might lead to a frank question on his part and a frank answer on mine. he spoke well of me to beardsleyans, he was my good herald. had he discovered          mes gotsand lolitas status, it would have interested him only insofar as throwing some light on the simplicity of my attitude towards          him, which attitude was as free of polite strain as it was of ribald allusions for despite his colorless mind and dim memory, he was perhaps aware that i knew more about him than the burghers of beardsley did. he was a flabby, doughfaced, melancholy bachelor tapering upward to a pair of narrow, not quite level shoulders and a conical pearhead which had sleek black hair on one side and only a few plastered wisps on the other. but the lower part of his body was enormous, and he ambulated with a curious elephantine stealth by means of phenomentally stout legs. he always woer black, even his tie was black he seldom bathed his english was a burlesque. and, nonetheless, everybody considered him to be a supremely lovable, lovably freakish fellow neighbors pampered him he knew by name all the small boys in our vicinity he lived a few blocks away from meand had some of them clean his sidewalk and burn leaves in his back yard, and bring wood from his shed, and even perform simple chores about the house, and he would feed them fancy chocolates, with          realliqueurs insidein the privacy of an orientally furnished den in his basement, with amusing daggers and pistols arrayed on the moldy, rugadorned walls among the camouflaged hotwater pipes. upstairs he had a studiohe painted a little, the old fraud. he had decorated its sloping wall it was really not more than a garret with large photographs of pensive andr gide, tchakovsky, norman douglas, two other wellknown english writers, nijinsky all thighs and fig leaves, harold d. doublename a mistyeyed leftwing professor at a midwesten university and marcel proust. all these poor people seemed about to fall on you from their inclined plane. he had also an album with snapshots of all the jackies and dickies of the neighborhood, and when i happened to thumb through it and make some casual remark, gaston would purse his fat lips and murmur with a wistful pout           oui, ils sont gentils. his brown eyes would roam around the various sentimental and artistic bricabrac present, and his own banal          toilesthe conventionally primitive eyes, sliced guitars, blue nipples and geometrical designs of the day, and with a vague gesture toward a painted wooden bowl or veined vase, he would say           prenez donc une de ces poires.         la bonne dame den face men offre plus que je nen peux savourer. or           mississe taille lore vient de me donner ces dahlias, belles fleurs que jexcre. somber, sad, full of worldweariness.         for obvious reasons, i preferred myhouse to his for the games of chess we had two or three times weekly. he looked like some old battered idol as he sat with his pudgy hands in his lap and stared at the board as if it were a corpse. wheezing he would mediate for ten minutesthen make a losing move. or the good man, after even more thought, might utter          au roiwith a slow olddog woof that had a gargling sound at the back of it which made his jowls wabble and then he would lift his circumflex eyebrows with a deep sigh as i pointed out to him that he was in check himself.         sometimes, from where we sat in my cold study i could hear los bare feet practicing dance techniques in the living room downstairs but gastons outgoing senses were comfortably dulled, and he remained unaware of those naked rhythmsandone, andtwo, andone, andtwo, weight transferred on a straight right leg, leg up and out to the side, andone, andtwo, and only when she started jumping, opening her legs at the height of the jump, and flexing one leg, and extending the other, and flying, and landing on her toesonly then did my pale, pompous, morose opponent rub his head or cheek a if confusing those distant thuds with the awful stabs of my formidable queen.         sometimes lola would slouch in while we pondered the boardand it was every time a treat to see gaston, his elephant eye still fixed on his pieces, ceremoniously rise to shake hands with her, and forthwith release her limp fingers, and without looking once at her, descend again into his chair to topple into the trap i had laid for him. one day around christmas, after i had not seen him for a fortnight or so, he asked me           et toutes vos fillettes, elles vont bien          from which it became evident to me that he had multiplied my unique lolita by the number of sartorial categories his downcast moody eye had glimpsed during a whole series of her appearances blue jeans, a skirt, shorts, a quilted robe.         i am loath to dwell so long on the poor fellow sadly enough, a year later, during a voyage to europe, from which he did not return, he got involved in a          sale histoire, in napes of all places. i would have hardly alluded to him at all had not his beardsley existence had such a queer bearing on my case. i need him for my defense. there he was devoid of any talent whatsoever, a mediocre teacher, a worthless scholar, a glum repulsive fat old invert, highly contemptuous of the american way of life, triumphantly ignorant of the english languagethere he was in priggish new england, crooned over by the old and caressed by the youngoh, having a grand time and fooling everybody and here was i.                                             i am now faced with the distasteful task of recording a definite drop in lolitas morals. if her share in the ardors she kindled had never amounted to much, neither had pure lucre ever come to the fore. but i was weak, i was not wise, my schoolgirl nymphet had me in thrall. with the human element dwindling, the passion, the tenderness, and the torture only increased and of this she took advantage.         her weekly allowance, paid to her under condition she fulfill her basic obligations, was twentyone cents at the start of the beardsley eraand went up to one dollar five before its end. this was a more than generous arrangement seeing she constantly received from me all kinds of small presents and had for the asking any sweetmeat or movie under the moonalthough, of course, i might fondly demand an additional kiss, or even a whole collection of assorted caresses, when i knew she coveted very badly some item of juvenile amusement. she was, however, not easy to deal with. only very listlessly did she earn her three penniesor three nickelsper day and she proved to be a cruel negotiator whenever it was in her power to deny me certain lifewrecking, strange, slow paradisal philters without which i could not live more than a few days in a row, and which, because of the very nature of loves languor, i could not obtain by force. knowing the magic and might of her own soft mouth, she managedduring one schoolyearto raise the bonus price of a fancy embrace to three, and even four bucks o reader laugh not, as you imagine me, on the very rack of joy noisily emitting dimes and quarters, and great big silver dollars like some sonorous, jingly and wholly demented machine vomiting riches and in the margin of that leaping epilepsy she would firmly clutch a handful of coins in her little fist, which, anyway, i used to pry open afterwards unless she gave me the slip, scrambling away to hide her loot. and just as every other day i would cruise all around the school area and on comatose feet visit drugstores, and peer into foggy lanes, and listen to receding girl laughter in between my heart throbs and the falling leaves, so every now and then i would burgle her room and scrutinize torn papers in the wastebasket with the painted roses, and look under the pillow of the virginal bed i had just made myself. once i found eight onedollar notes in one of her books fittingly          treasure island, and once a hole in the wall behind whistlers mother yielded as much as twentyfour dollars and some changesay twentyfour sixtywhich i quietly removed, upon which, next day, she accused, to my face, honest mrs. holigan of being a filthy thief. eventually, she lived up to her i.q. by finding a safer hoarding place which i never discovered but by that time i had brought prices down drastically by having her earn the hard and nauseous way permission to participate in the schools theatrical program because what i feared most was not that she might ruin me, but that she might accumulate sufficient cash to run away. i believe the poor fierceeyed child had figured out that with a mere fifty dollars in her urse she might somehow reach broadway or hollywoodor the foul kitchen of a diner help wanted in a dismal exprairie state, with the wind blowing, and the stars blinking, and the cars, and the bars, and the barmen, and everything soiled, torn, dead.                                             i did my best, your honr, to tackele the problem of boys. oh, i used even to read in the beardsley star a socalled column for teens, to find out how to behave                    a word to fathers.           dont frighten away daughters friend. maybe it is a bit hard for you to realize that now the boys are finding her attractive. to you she is still a little girl. to the boys shes charming and fun, lovely and gay. they like her. today you clinch big deals in an exectuvies office, but yesterday you were just highschool jim carrying janes school books. remember dont you want your daughter, now that her turn has come, to be happy in the admiration and company of boys she likes dont you want your daughter, now that her turn has come, to be happy in the admiration and company of boys she likes dont you want them to have wholesome fun together                  wholesome fun good lord                    why not treat the young fellows as guests in your house why not make conversation with them draw them out, make them laugh and feel at ease                  welcome, fellow, to this brdello.                    if she breaks the rules dont explode out loud in front of her partner in crime. let her take the brunt of your displeasure in private. and stop making the boys feel shes the daughter of an old ogre.                  first of all the old ogre drew up a list under absolutely forbidden and another under reluctantly allowed. absolutely forbidden were dates, single or double or triplethe next step being of course mass orgy. she might visit a candy bar with her girl friends, and there gigglechat with occasional young males, while i waited in the car at a discreet distance and i promised her that if her group were invited by a socially acceptable group in butlers academy for boys for their annual ball heavily chaperoned, of course, i might consider the question whether a girl of fourteen can don her first formal a kind of gown that makes thinarmed teenagers look like flamingoes. moreover, i promised her to throw a party a t our house to which she would be allowed to invite her prettier girl friends and the nicer boys she would have met by that time at the butler dance. but i was quite positive that as long as my regime lasted she would never, never be permitted to go with a youngster in rut to a movie, or neck in a car, or go to boygirl parties at the housesof schoolmates, or indulge out of my earshot in boygirl telephone conversations, even if only discussing his relations with a friend of mine.         lo was enraged by all thiscalled me a lousy crook and worseand i would probably have lost my temper had i not soon discovered, to my sweetest relief, that what really angered her was my depriving her not of a specific satisfaction but of a general right. i was impinging, you see, on the conventional program, the stock pastimes, the things that are done, the routie of youth for there is nothing more conservative than a child, especially a girlchild, be she the most auburn and russet, the most mythopoeic nymphet in octobers orchardhaze.         do not misunderstand me. i cannot be absolutely certain that in the course of the winter she did not manage to have, in a casual way, improper contacts with unknown young fellows of course, no matter how closely i controlled her leisure, there would constantly occur unaccountedfor time leaks with overelaborate explanations to stop them up in retrospect of course, my jealousy would constantly catch its jagged claw in the fine fabrics of nymphet falsity but i did definitely feeland can now vouchsafe for the accuracy of my feelingthat there was no reason for serious alarm. i felt that way not because i never once discovered any palpable hard young throat to crush among the masculine mutes that flickered somewhere in the background but because it was to me overwhelmingly obvious a favorite expression with my aunt sybil that all varieties of high school boysfrom the perspiring nincompoop whom holding hands thrills, to the selfsufficient rapist with pustules and a soupedup carequally bored my sophisticated young mistress. all this noise about boys gags me, she had scrawled on the inside of a schoolbook, and underneath, in monas hand mona is due any minute now, there was the sly quip what about rigger due too.         faceless, then, are the chappies i happened to see in her company. there was for instance red sweater who one day, the day we had the first snowsaw her home from the parlor window i observed them talking near our porch. she wre her first cloth coat with a fur collar there was a small brown cap on my favorite hairdothe fringe in front and the swirl at the sides and the natural curls at the backand her dampdark moccasins and white socks were more sloppy than ever. she pressed as usual her books to her chest while speaking or listening, and her feet gestured all the time she would stand on her left instep with her right toe, remove it backward, cross her feet, rock slightly, sketch a few steps, and then start the series all over again. there was windbreaker who talked to her in front of a restaurant one sunday afternoon while his mother and sister attempted to walk me away for a chat i dragged along and looked back at my only love. she had developed more than one conventional mannerism, such as the polite adolescent way of showing one is literally doubled up with laughter by incling ones head, and so as she sensed my call, still feigning helpless merriment, she walked backward a couple of steps, and then faced about, and walked toward me with a fading smile. on the other hand, i greatly likedperhaps because it reminded me of her first unforgettable confessionher trick of sighing oh dear in humorous wistufl submission to fate, or emitting a long noo in a deep almost growling undertone when thye blow of fate had actually fallen. above allsince we are speaking of movement and youthi liked to see her spinning up and down thayer street on her beautiful young bicycle rising on the pedals to work on them lustily, then sinking back in a languid posture while the speed wore itself off and then she would stop at our mailbox and, still astride, would flip through a magazine she found there, and put it back, and press her tongue to one side of her upper lip and push off with her foot, and again sprint through pale shade and sun.         on the whole she seemed to me better adapted to her surroundings than i had hoped she would be when considering my spoiled slavechild and the bangles of demeanor she navely affected the winter before in california. although i could never get used to the constant state of anxiety in which the guilty, the great, the tenderhearted live, i felt i was doing my best in the way of mimicry. as i lay on my narrow studio bed a fter asession of adoration and despair in lolitas cold bedroom, i used to review the concluded day by checking my own image as it prowled rather than passed before the minds red eye. i watched darkandhandsome, not unceltic, probably highchurch, possibly very highchurch, dr. humbert see his daughter off to school i watched him greet with his slow smile and pleasantly arched thick black adeyebrows good mrs. holigan, who smelled of the plague and would head, i knew, for masters gin at the first opportunity. with mr. west, retired executioner or writer of religious tractswho caredi saw neighbor whats his name, i think they are french or swiss, meditate in his frankwindowed study over a typewriter, rather gauntprofiled, an almost hitlerian cowlick on his pale brow. weekends, wearing a welltailored overcoat and brown gloves, professor h. might be seen with his daughter strolling to walton inn famous for its violetribboned china bunnies and chocolate boxes among which you sit and wait for a table for two still filthy with your predecessors crumbs. seen on weekdays, around one p.m. , saluting with dignity arguseyed east while maneuvering the car out of the garage and around the damned evergreens, and down onto the slippery road. raising a cold eye from book to clock in the positively sultry beardsley college library, among bulky young women caught and petrified in the overflow of human knowledge. walking across the campus with the college clergyman, the rev. rigger who also taught bible in beardsley school. somebody told me her mother was a celebrated actress killed in an airplane accident. oh my mistake, i presume. is that so i see. how sad. sublimating her mother, eh slowly pushing my little pram through the labyrinth of the supermarket, in the wake of professor w., also a slowmoving and gentle widower with the eyes of a goat. shoveling the snow in my shirtsleeves, a voluminous black and white muffler around my neck. following with no show of rapacious haste even taking time to wipe my feet on the mat my schoolgirl daughter into the house. taking dolly to the dentistpretty nurse beaming at herold magazines          ne montrez pas vos zhambes. at dinner with dolly in town, mr. edgar h. humbert was seen eating his steak in the continental knifeandfork manner. enjoying, in duplicate, a concert two marblefaced, becalmed frenchmen sitting side by side, with monsieur h. h.s musical little girl on her fathers right, and the musical little boy of professor w. father spending a hygienic evening in providence on monsieur g. g.s left. opening the garage, a square of light that engulfs the car and is extinguished. brightly pajamaed, jerking down the window shade in dollys bedroom. saturday morning, unseen, solemnly weighing the winterbleached lassie in the bathroom. seen and heard sunday morning, no chruchgoer after all, saying dont be too late, to dolly who is bound for the covered court. letting in a queerly observant schoolmate of dollys first time ive seen a man wearing a smoking jacket, sirexcept in movies, of course.                                             her girlfriends, whom i looked forward to meet, proved on the whole disappointing. there was opal something, and linda hall, and avis chapman, and eva rosen, and mona dahl save one, all these names are approximations, of course. opal was a bashful, formless, bespectacled, bepimpled creature who doted on dolly who bullied her. with linda hall the school tennis champion, dolly played singles at least twice a week i suspect linda was a true nymphet, but for some unknown reason she did not comewas perhaps not allowed to cometo our house so i recall her only as a flash of natural sunshine on an indoor court. of the rest, none had any claims to nymphetry except eva rosen. avis ws a plump lateral child with hairy legs, while mona, though handsome in a coarse sensual way and only a year older than my aging mistress, had obviously long ceased to be a nymphet, if she ever had been one. eva rosen, a displaced little person from france, was on the other hand a good example of a not strikingly beautiful child revealing to the perspicacious amateur some of the basic elements of nymphet charm, such as a perfect pubescent figure and lingering eyes and high cheekbones. her glossy copper hair had lolitas silkiness, and the features of her delicate milkywhite face with pink lips and silverfish eyelashes were less foxy than those of her likesthe great clan of intraracial redheads nor did she sport their green uniform but wore, as i remember her, a lot of black or cherry darka very smart black pullover, for instance, and highheeled black shoes, and garnetred fingernail polish. i spoke french to her much to los disgust. the childs tonalities were still admirably pure, but for school words and play words she resorted to current american and then a slight brooklyn accent would crop up in her speech, which was amusing in a little parisian who went to a select new england school with phoney british aspirations. unfortunately, despite that french kids uncle being a millionaire, lo dropped eva for some reason before i had had time to enjoy in my modest way her fragrant presence in the humbert open house. the reader knows what importance i attached to having a bevy of page girls, consolation prize nymphets, around my lolita. for a while, i endeavored to interest my senses in mona dahl who was a good deal around, especially during the spring term when lo and she got so enthusiastic about dramatics. i have often wondered what secrets outrageously treacherous dolores haze had imparted to mona while blurting out to me by urgent and wellpaid request various really incredible details concerning an affair that mona had had with a marine at the seaside. it was characteristic of lo that she chose for her closest chum that elegant, cold, lascivious, experienced young female whom i once heard misheard, lo swore cheerfully say in the hallway to lowho had remarked that her los sweater was of virgin wool the only thing about you that is, kiddo she had a curiously husky voice, artificially waved dull dark hair, earrings, amberbrown prominent eyes and luscious lips. lo said teachers had remonstrated with her on her loading herself with so much costume jewelry. her hands trembled. she was burdened with a  i.q. and i also knew she had a tremendous chocolatebrown mole on he womanish back which i inspected the night lo and she had worn lowcut pastelcolored, vaporous dresses for a dance at the butler academy.         i am anticipating a little, but i cannot help running my memory all over the keyboard of that shcool year. in the meeting my attempts to find out what kind of boys lo knew, miss dahl was elegantly evasive. lo who had gone to play tennis at lindas country club had telephoned she might be a full half hour late, and so, would i enteretain mona who was coming to practice with her a scene from          the taming of the shrew.using all the modulations, all the allure of manner and voice she was capable of and staring at me with perhapscould i be mistakena faint gleam of crystalline irony, beautiful mona replied well, sir, the fact is dolly is not much concerned with mere boys. fact is, we are rivals. she and i have a crush on the reverend rigger. this was a jokei have already mentioned that gloomy giant of a man, with the jaw of a horse he was to bore me to near murder with his impressions of switzerland at a tea party for parents that i am unable to place correctly in terms of time.         how had the ball been oh, it had been a riot. a what a panic. terrific, in a word. had lo danced a lot oh, not a frightful lot, just as much as she could stand. what did she, languorous mona, think of lo sir did she think lo was doing well at school gosh, she certainly was quite a kid. but her general behavior was oh, she was a swell kid. but still oh, shes a doll, concluded mona, and sighed abruptly, and picked up a book that happened to lie at hand, and with a change of expression, falsely furrowing her brow, inquired do tell me about ball zack, sir. is he really that good she moved up so close to my chair that i made out through lotions and creams her uninteresting skin scent. a sudden odd thought stabbed me was my lo playing the pimp if so, she had found the wrong substitute. avoiding mona cool gaze, i talked literature for a minute. then dolly arrivedand slit her pale eyes at us. i left the two friends to their own devices. one of the latticed squares in a small cobwebby casement window at the turn of the staircase was glazed with ruby, and that raw wound among the unstained rectangles and its asymmetrical positiona nights move from the topalways strangely disturbed me.                                             sometimes come on, how often exactly, bert can you recall four, five, more such occasions or would no human heart have survived two or three sometimes i have nothing to say in reply to your question, while lolita would be haphazardly preparing her homework, sucking a pencil, lolling sideways in an easy chair with both legs over its arm, i would shed all my pedagogic restraint, dismiss all our quarrels, forget all my masculine prideand literally crawl on my knees to your chair, my lolita you would give me one looka gray furry question mark of a look oh no, not again incredulity, exasperation for you never deigned to believe that i could, without any specific designs, ever crave to bury my face in your plaid skirt, my darling the fragility of those bare arms of yourshow i longed to enfold them, all your four limpid lovely limbs, a folded colt, and take your head between my unworthy hands, and pull the templeskin back on both sides, and kiss your chinesed eyes, andpulease, leave me alone, will you, you would say, for christs sake leave me alone. and i would get up from the floor while you looked on, your face deliberately twitching in imitation of my          tic nerveux. but never mind, never mind, i am only a brute, never mind, let us go on with my miserable story.                                             one monday forenoon, in december i think, pratt asked me to come over for a talk. dollys last report had been poor, i knew. but instead of contenting myself with some such plausible explaination of this summons, i imagined all sort of horrors, and had to fortify myself with a pint of my pin before i could face the interview. slowly, all adams apple and heart, i went up the steps of the scaffold.         a huge women, grayhaired, frowsy, with a broad flat nose and small eyes behind blackrimmed glassessit down, she said, pointing to an informal and humiliating hassock, while she perched with ponderous spryness on the arm of an oak chair. for a moment or two, she peered at me with smiling curiosity.she had done it at our first meeting, i recalled, but i could afford then to scowl back. her eye left me. she lapsed into thoughtprobably assumed. making up her mind she rubbed, fold on fold, her dark gray flannel skirt at the knee, dispelling a trace of chalk or something. then she said, still rubbing, not looking up         let me ask a blunt question, mr. haze. you are an oldfashioned continental father, arent you         why, no, i said, conservative, perhaps, but not what you would call oldfashioned.         she sighed, frowned, then clapped her big plump hands together in a letsgetdowntobusiness manner, and again fixed her beady eyes upon me.         dolly haze, she said, is a lovely child, but the onset of sexual maturing seems to give her trouble.         i bowed slightly. what else could i do         she is still shuttling, said miss pratt, showing how with her liverspotted hands, between the anal and genital zones of development. basically she is a lovely         i beg your pardon, i said, what zones         thats the oldfashioned european in you cried pratt delivering a slight tap on my wrist watch and suddenly disclosing her dentures. all i mean is that biologic drivesdo you smokeare not fused in dolly, do not fall so to speak into ainto a rounded pattern. her hands held for a moment an invisible melon.         she is attractive, birght though careless breathing heavily, without leaving her perch, the woman took time out to look at the lovely childs report sheet on the desk at her right. her marks are getting worse and worse. now i wonder, mr. haze again the false meditation.         well, she went on with zest, as for me, i do smoke, and, as dear dr. pierce used to say im not proud of it but i jeest love it. she lit up and the smoke she exhaled from her nostrils was like a pair of tusks.         let me give you a few details, it wont take a moment. now here let me see rummaging among her papers. she is defiant toward miss redcock and impossibly rude to miss cormorant. now here is one of our special research reports enjoys singing with group in class though mind seems to wander. crosses her knees and wags left leg to rhythm. type of bywords a twohundredfortytwo word area of the commonest pubescent slang fenced in by a number of obviously european polysyllabics. sighs a good deal in class. let me see. yes. now comes the last week in november. sighs a good deal in class. chews gum vehemently. does not bite her nails though if she did, this would conform better to her general patternscientifically speaking, of course. menstruation, according to the subject, well established. belongs at present to no church organization. by the way, mr. haze, her mother was oh, i see. and you are nobodys business is, i suppose, gods business. something else we wanted to know. she was no regular home duties, i understand. making a princess of your dolly, mr. haze, he well, what else have we got here handles books gracefully. voice pleasant. giggles rather often. a little dreamy. has private jokes of her own, transposing for instance the first letters of some of her teachers names. hair light and dark brown, lustrouswell laughing you are aware of          that, i suppose. nose unobstructed, feet higharched, eyeslet me see, i had here somewhere a still more recent report. aha, here we are. miss gold says dollys tennis form is excellent to superb, even better than linda halls, but concentration and pointaccumulation are just poor to fair. miss cormorant cannot decide whether dolly has exceptional emotional control or none at all. miss horn reports shei mean, dollycannot verbalize her emotions, while according to miss cole dollys metabolic efficiency is superfine. miss molar thinks dolly is myopic and should see a good ophthalmologist, but miss redcock insists that the girl simulates eyestrain to get away with scholastic incompetence. and to conclude, mr. haze, our researchers are wondering about something really crucial. now i want to ask you something. i want to know if your poor wife, or yourself, or anyone else in the familyi understand she has several aunts and a maternal grandfather in californiaoh,          hadim sorrywell, we all wonder if anybody in the family has instructed dolly in the process of mammalian reproduction. the general impression is that fifteenyearold dolly remains morbidly uninterested in sexual matters, or to be exact, represses her curiosity in order to save her ignorance and selfdignity. all rightfourteen. you see, mr. haze, beardsley school does not believe in bees and blossoms, and storks and love birds, but it does believe very strongly in preparing its students for mutually satisfactory mating and successful child rearing. we feel dolly could make excellent progress if only she would put her mind to her work. miss cormorants report is significant in that respect. dolly is inclined to be, mildly speaking impudent. but all feel that          primo, you should have your family doctor tell her the facts of life and          , secudno, that you allow her to enjoy the company of her schoolmates brothers at the junior club or in dr. riggers organization, or in the lovely homes of our parents.         she may meet boys at her own lovely home, i said.         i hope she will, said pratt buoyantly. when we questioned her about her troubles, dolly refused to discuss the home situation, but we have spoken to some of her friends and reallywell, for example, we insist you unveto her nonparticiaption in the dramatic group. you just must allow her to tak part in          the hunted enchanters. she was such a perfect little nymph in the tryout, and sometime in spring the author will stay for a few days at beardsley college and may attend a rehearsal or two in our new auditorium. i mean it is all part of the fun of being young and alive and beautiful. you must understand         i always thought of myself, i said, as a very understanding father.         oh, no doubt, no doubt, but miss cormorant thinks, and i am inclined to agree with her, that dolly is obsessed by sexual thoughts for which she finds no outlet, and will tease and martyrize other girls, or even our younger instructors because          theydo have innocent dates with boys.         shrugged my shoulders. a shabby          migr.         let us put our two heads together, mr. haze. what on earth is wrong with that child         she seems quite normal and happy to me, i said disaster coming at last was i found out had they got some hypnotist.         what worries me, said miss pratt looking at her watch and starting to go over the whole subject again, is that both teachers and schoolmates find dolly antagonistic, dissatisfied, cageyand everybody wonders why you are so firly opposed to all the natural recreations of a normal child.         do you mean sex play i asked jauntily, in despair, a cornered old rat.         well, i certainly welcome this civilized terminology, said pratt with a grin. but this is not quite the point. under the auspices of beardsley school, dramatics, dances and other natural activities are not technically sex play, though girls do meet boys, if that is what you object to.         all right, i said, my hassock exhaling a weary sign. you win. she can take part in that play. provided male parts are taken by female parts.         i am always fascinated, said pratt, by the admirable way foreignersor at least naturalized americansuse our rich language. im sure miss gold, who conducts the play group, will be overjoyed. i notice she is one of the few teachers that seem to likei mean who seem to find dolly manageable. this takes care of general topics, i guess now comes a special matter. we are in trouble again.         pratt paused truculently, then rubbed her index finger under her nostrils with such vigor that her nose performed a kind of war dance.         im a frank person, she said, but conventions are conventions, and i find it difficult let me put it this way the walkers, who live in what we call around here the dukes manor, you know the great gray house on the hillthey send their two girls to our school, and we have the niece of president moore with us, a really gracious child, not to speak of a number of other prominent children. well, under the circumstances, it is rather a jolt when dolly, who looks like a little lady, uses words which you as a foreigner probably simply do not know or do not understand. perhaps it might be betterwould you like me to have dolly come up here right away to discuss things no you seeoh well, lets have it out. dolly has written a most obscene fourletter word which our dr. cutler tells me is lowmexican for urinal with her lipstick on some health pamphlets which miss redcock, who is getting married in june, distributed among the girls, and we thought she should stay after hoursanother half hour at least. but if you like         no, i said, i dont want to interfere with rules. i shall talk to her later. i shall thrash it out.         do, said the woman rising from her chair arm. and perhaps we can get together again soon, and if things do not improve we might have dr. cutler analyze her.         should i marry pratt and strangle her         and perhaps your family doctor might like to examine her physicallyjust a routine checkup. she is in mushroomthe last classroom along that passage.         beardsley school, it may be explained, copied a famous girls school in england by having traditional nicknames for its various classrooms mushroom, roomin , broom, roomba and so on. mushroom was smelly, with a sepia print of reynolds age of innocence above the chalkboard, and several rows of clumsylooking pupil desks. at one of these, my lolita was reading the chapter on dialogue in bakers          dramatic technique, and all was very quiet, and there was another girl with a very naked, porcelainwhite neck and wonderful platinum hair, who sat in front reading too, absolutely lost to the world and interminably winding a soft curl around one finger, and i sat beside dolly just behind that neck and that hair, and unbuttoned my overcoat and for sixtyfive cents plus the permission to participate in the school play, had dolly put her inky, chalky, redknuckled hand under the desk. oh, stupid and reckless of me, no doubt, but after the torture i had been subjected to, i simply had to take advantage of a combination that i knew would never occur again.                                             around christmas she caught a bad chill and was examined by a friend of miss lester, a dr. ilse tristramson hi, ilse, you were a dear, uninquisitive soul, and you touched my dove very gently. she diagnosed bronchitis, patted lo on the back all its bloom erect because of the fever and put her to bed for a week or longer. at first she ran a temperature in american parlance, and i could not resist the exquisite caloricity of unexpected delightsvenus febriculosathough it was a very languid lolita that moaned and coughed and shivered in my embrace. and as soon as she was well again, i threw a party with boys.         perhaps i had drunk a little too much in preparation for the ordeal. perhaps i made a fool of myself. the girls had decorated and plugged in a small fir treegerman custom, except that colored bulbs had superseded wax candles. records were chosen and fed into my landlords phonograph. chic dolly wore a nice gray dress with fitted bodice and flared skirt. humming, i retired to my study upstairsand then every ten or twenty minutes i would come down like an idiot just for a few seconds to pick up ostensibly my pipe from the mantelpiece or hunt for the newspaper and with every new visit these simple actions became harder to perform, and i was reminded of the dreadfully distant days when i used to brace myself to casually enter a room in the ramsdale house where little carmen was on.         the party was not a success. of the three girls invited, one did not come at all, and one of the boys brought his cousin roy, so there was a superfluity of two boys, and the cousins knew all the steps, and the other fellows could hardly dance at all, and most of the evening was spent in messing up the kitchen, and then endlessly jabbering about what card game to play, and sometime later, two girls and four boys sat on the floor of the living room, with all windows open, and played a word game which opal could not be made to understand, while mona and roy, a lean handsome lad, drank ginger ale in the kitchen, sitting on the table and dangling their legs, and hotly discussing predestination and the law of averages. after they had all gone my lo said ugh, closed her eyes, and dropped into a chair with all four limbs starfished to express the utmost disgust and exhaustion and swore it was the most revolting bunch of boys she had ever seen. i bought her a new tennis racket for that remark.         january was humid and warm, and february fooled the forsythia none of the townspeople had ever          seensuch weather. other presents came tumbling in. for her birthday i bought her a bicycle, the doelike and altogether charming machine already mentionedand added to this a          history of modern american painting her bicycle manner, i mean her approach to it, the hip movement in mounting, the grace and so on, afforded me supreme pleasure but my attempt to refine her pictorial taste was a failure she wanted to know if the guy noonnapping on doris lees hay was the father of the pseudovoluptuous hoyden in the foreground, and could not understand why i said grant wood or peter hurd was good, and reginald marsh or frederick waugh awful.                                             by the time spring had touched up thayer street with yellow and green and pink, lolita was irrevocably stagestruck. pratt, whom i chanced to notice one sunday lunching with some people at walton inn, caught my eye from afar and went through the motion of sympathetically and discreetly clapping her hands while lo was not looking. i detest the theatre as being a primitive and putrid form, historically speaking a form that smacks of stoneage rites and communal nonsense despite those individual injections of genius, such as, say, elizabethan poetry which a closeted reader automatically pumps out of the stuff. being much occupied at the time with my own literary labors, i did not bother to read the complete text of          the enchanted hunters, the playlet in which dolores haze was assigned the part of a farmers daughter who imagines herself to be a woodland witch, or diana, or something, and who, having got hold of a book on hypnotism, plunges a number of lost hunters into various entertaining trances before falling in her turn under the spell of a vagabond poet mona dahl. that much i gleaned from bits of crumpled and poorly typed script that lo sowed all over the house. the coincidence of the title with the name of an unforgettable inn was pleasant in a sad little way i wearily thought i had better not bring it to my own enchantresss notice, lest a brazen accusation of mawkishness hurt me even more than her failure to notice it for herself had done. i assumed the playlet was just another, practically anonymous, version of some banal legend. nothing prevented one, of course, from supposing that in quest of an attractive name the founder of the hotel had been immediately and solely influenced by the chance fantasy of the secondrate muralist he had hired, and that subsequently the hotels name had suggested the plays title. but in my credulous, simple, benevolent mind i happened to twist it the other way round, and without giving the whole matter much though really, supposed that mural, name and title had all been derived from a common source, from some local tradition, which i, an alien unversed in new england lore, would not be supposed to know. in consequence i was under the impression all this quite casually, you understand, quite outside my orbit of importance that the accursed playlet belonged to the type of whimsy for juvenile consumption, arranged and rearranged many times, such as          hansel and gretelby richard roe, or          the sleeping beautyby dorothy doe, or          the emperors new clothesby maurice vermont and marion rumpelmeyerall this to be found in any          plays for school actorsor          lets have a playin other words, i did not knowand would not have cared, if i did that actually          the enchanted hunterswas a quite recent and technically original composition which had been produced for the first time only three or four months ago by a highbrow group in new york. to meinasmuch as i could judge from my charmers partit seemed to be a pretty dismal kind of fancy work, with echoes from lenormand and maeterlinck and various quiet british dreamers. the redcapped, uniformly attired hunters, of which one was a banker, another a plumber, a third a policeman, a fourth an undertaker, a fifth an underwriter, a sixth an escaped convict you see the possibilities, went through a complete change of mind in dollys dell, and remembered their real lives only as dreams or nightmares from which little diana had aroused them but a seventh hunter in a          greencap, the fool was a young poet, and he insisted, much to dianas annoyance, that she and the entertainment provided dancing nymphs, and elves, and monsters were his, the poets, invention. i understand that finally, in utter disgust at his cocksureness, barefooted dolores was to lead checktrousered mona to the paternal farm behind the perilous forest to prove to the braggart she was not a poets fancy, but a rustic, downtobrownearth lassand a lastminute kiss was to enforce the plays profound message, namely, that mirage and reality merge in love. i considered it wiser not to criticize the thing in front of lo she was so healthily engrossed in problems of expression, and so charmingly did she put her narrow florentine hands together, batting her eyelashes and pleading with me not to come to rehearsals as some ridiculous parents did because she wanted to dazzle me with a perfect first nightand because i was, anyway, always butting in and saying the wrong thing, and cramping her style in the presence of other people.         there was one very special rehearsal my heart, my heart there was one day in may marked by a lot of gay flurryit all rolled past, beyond my ken, immune to my memory, and when i saw lo next, in the late afternoon, balancing on her bike, pressing the palm of her hand to the damp bark of a young birch tree on the edge of our lawn, i was so struck by the radiant tenderness of her smile that for an instant i believed all our troubles gone. can you remember, she said, what was the name of that hotel,          youknow nose pucketed, come on, you knowwith those white columns and the marble swan in the lobby oh, you know noisy exhalation of breaththe hotel where you raped me. okay, skip it. i mean, was it almost in a whisper the enchanted hunters oh, it was musingly was itand with a yelp of amorous vernal laughter she slapped the glossy bole and tore uphill, to the end of the street, and then rode back, feet at rest on stopped pedals, posture relaxed, one hand dreaming in her printflowered lap.                                             because it supposedly tied up with her interest in dance and dramatics, i had permitted lo to take piano lessons with a miss emperor as we french scholars may conveniently call her to whose blueshuttered little white house a mile or so beyond beardsley lo would spin off twice a week. one friday night toward the end of may and a week or so after the very special rehearsal lo had not had me attend the telephone in my study, where i was in the act of mopping up gustavesi mean gastonskings side, rang and miss emperor asked if lo was coming next tuesday because she had missed last tuesdays and todays lessons. i said she would by all meansand went on with the game. as the reader may well imagine, my faculties were now impaired, and a move or two later, with gaston to play, i noticed through the film of my general distress that he could collect my queen he noticed it too, but thinking it might be a trap on the part of his tricky opponent, he demurred for quite a minute, and puffed and wheezed, and shook his jowls, and even shot furtive glances at me, and made hesitating halfthrusts with his pudgily bunched fingersdying to take that juicy queen and not daringand all of a sudden he swooped down upon it who knows if it did not teach him certain later audacities, and i spent a dreary hour in achieving a draw. he finished his brandy and presently lumbered away, quite satisfied with this result           mon         pauvre ami, je ne vous ai jamais revu et quoiquil y ait bien peu de chance que vous voyiez mon livre, permiettezmoi de vous dire que je vous serre la main bien cordialement, et que toutes mes fillettes vous saluent. i found dolores haze at the kitchen table, consuming a wedge of pie, with her eyes fixed on her script. they rose to meet mine with a kind of celestial vapidity. she remained singularly unruffled when confronted with my discovery, and said          dun petit air faussement contritthat she knew she was a very wicked kid, but simply had not been able to resist the enchantment, and had used up those music hourso reader, my readerin a nearby public park rehearsing the magic forest scene with mona. i said fineand stalked to the telephone. monas mother answered oh yes, shes in and retreated with a mothers neutral laugh of polite pleasure to shout off stage roy calling and the very next moment mona rustled up, and forthwith, in a low monotonous not untender voice started berating roy for something he had said or done and i interrupted her, and presently mona was saying in her humbles, sexiest contralto, yes, sir, surely, sir i am alone to blame, sir, in this unfortunate business, what elocution what poise honest, i feel very bad about itand so on and so forth as those little harlots say.         so downstairs i went clearing my throat and holding my heart. lo was now in the living room, in her favorite overstuffed chair. as she sprawled there, biting at a hangnail an mocking me with her heartless vaporous eyes, and all the time rocking a stool upon which she had placed the heel of an outstretched shoeless foot, i perceived all at once with a sickening qualm how much she had changed since i first met her two years ago. or had this happened during those last two weeks          tendressesurely that was an exploded myth. she sat right in the focus of my incandescent anger. the fog of all lust had been swept away leaving nothing but this dreadful lucidity. oh, she had changed her complexion was now that of any vulgar untidy highschool girl who applies shared cosmetics with grubby fingers to an unwashed face and does not mind what soiled texture, what pustulate epidermis comes in contact with her skin. its smooth tender bloom had been so lovely in former days, so bright with tears, when i used to roll, in play, her tousled head on my knee. a coarse flush had now replaced that innocent fluorescence. what was locally known as a rabbit cold had painted with flaming pink the edges of her contemptuous nostrils. as in terror i lowered my gaze, it mechanically slid along the underside of her tensely stretched bare thighhow polished and muscular her legs had grown she kept her wideset eyes, cloudedglass gray and slightly bloodshot, fixed upon me, and i saw the stealthy thought showing through them that perhaps after all mona was right, and she, orphan lo, could expose me without getting penalized herself. how wrong i was. how mad i was everything about her was of the same exasperating impenetrable orderthe strength of her shapely legs, the dirty sole of her white sock, the thick sweater she wore despite the closeness of the room, her wenchy smell, and especially the dead end of her face with its strange flush and freshly madeup lips. some of the red had left stains on her front teeth, and i was struck by a ghastly recollectionthe evoked image not of monique, but of another young prostitute in a bellhouse, ages ago, who had been snapped up by somebody else before i had time to decide whether her mere youth warranted my risking some appalling disease, and who had just such flushed prominent          pommettesand a dead          maman, and big front teeth, and a bit of dingy red ribbon in her countrybrown hair.         well, speak, said lo. was the corroboration satisfactory         oh, yes, i said. perfect. yes. and i do not doubt you two made it up. as a matter of fact, i do not doubt you have told her everything about us.         oh, yah         i controlled my breath and said dolores, this must stop right away. i am ready to yank you out of beardsley and lock you up you know where, but this must stop. i am ready to take you away the time it takes to pack a suitcase. this must stop or else anything may happen.         anything may happen, huh         i snatched away the stool she was rocking with her heel and her foot fell with a thud on the floor.         hey, she cried, take it easy.         first of all you go upstairs, i cried in my turn,and simultaneously grabbed at her and pulled her up. from that moment, i stopped restraining my voice, and we continued yelling at each other, and she said, unprintable things. she said she loathed me. she made monstrous faces at me, inflating her cheeks and producing a diabolical plopping sound. she said i had attempted to violate her several times when i was her mothers roomer. she said she was sure i had murdered her mother. she said she would sleep with the very first fellow who asked her and i could do nothing about it. i said she was to go upstairs and show me all her hiding places. it was a strident and hateful scene. i held her by her knobby wrist and she kept turning and twisting it this way and that, surreptitiously trying to find a weak point so as to wrench herself free at a favorable moment, but i held her quite hard and in fact hurt her rather badly for which i hope my heart may rot, and once or twice she jerked her arm so violently that i feared her wrist might snap, and all the while she stared at me with those unforgettable eyes where could anger and hot tears struggled, and our voices were drowning the telephone, and when i grew aware of its ringing she instantly escaped.         with people in movies i seem to share the services of the machina telephonica and its sudden god. this time it was an irate neighbor. the east window happened to be agape in the living room, with the blind mercifully down, however and behind it the damp black night of a sour new england spring had been breathlessly listening to us. i had always thought that type of haddocky spinster with the obscene mind was the result of considerable literary inbreeding in modern fiction but now i am convinced that prude and prurient miss eastor to explode her incognito, miss fenton lebonehad been probably protruding threequarterway from her bedroom window as she strove to catch the gist of our quarrel.         this racket lacks all sense of quacked the receiver, we do not live in a tenement here. i must emphatically         i apologized for my daughters friends being so loud. young people, you knowand cradled the next quack and a half.         downstairs the screen door banged. lo escaped         through the casement on the stairs i saw a small impetuous ghost slip through the shrubs a silvery dot in the darkhub of the bicycle wheelmoved, shivered, and she was gone.         it so happened that the car was spending the night in a repair shop downtown. i had no other alternative than to pursue on foot the winged fugitive. even now, after more than three years have heaved and elapsed, i cannot visualize that springnight street, that already so leafy street, without a gasp of panic. before their lighted porch miss lester was promenading miss favians dropsical dackel. mr. hyde almost knocked it over. walk three steps and runt three. a tepid rain started to drum on the chestnut leaves. at the next corner, pressing lolita against an iron railing, a blurred youth held and kissedno, not her, mistake. my talons still tingling, i flew on.         half a mile or so east of number fourteen, thayer street tangles with a private lane and a cross street the latter leads to the town proper in front of the first drugstore, i sawwith what melody of relieflolitas fair bicycle waiting for her. i pushed instead of pulling, pulled, pushed, pulled, and entered. look out some ten paces away lolita, though the glass of a telephone booth membranous god still with us, cupping the tube, confidentially hunched over it, slit her eyes at me, turned away with her treasure, hurriedly hung up, and walked out with a flourish.         tried to reach you at home, she said brightly. a great decision has been made. but first buy me a drink, dad.         she watched the listless pale fountain girl put in the ice, pour in the coke, add the cherry syrupand my heart was bursting with loveache. that childish wrist. my lovely child. you have a lovely child, mr. humbert. we always admire her as she passes by. mr. pim watched pippa suck in the concoction.                  jai toujours admir laeuvre du sublime dublinois. and in the meantime the rain had become a voluptuous shower.         look, she said as she rode the bike beside me, one foot scraping the darkly glistening sidewalk, look, ive decided something. i want to leave school i hate that school i hate the play, i really do never go back. find another. leave at once. go for a long trip again. but          thistime well go wherever          iwant, wont we         i nodded. my lolita.         i choose          cest entendu she asked wobbling a little beside me. used french only when she was a very good little girl.         okay.          entendu. now hophophop, lenore, or youll get soaked. a storm of sobs was filling my chest.         she bared her teeth and after her adorable schoolgirl fashioned, leaned forward, and away she sped, my bird.         miss lesters finely groomed hand held a porchdoor open for a waddling old dog          qui prenait son temps.         lo was waiting for me near the ghostly birch tree.         i am drenched, she declared at the top of her voice. are you glad to hell with the play see what i mean         an invisible hags claw slammed down an upperfloor window.         in our hallway, ablaze with welcoming lights, my lolita peeled off her sweater, shook her gemmed hair, stretched towards me two bare arms, raised one knee         carry me upstairs, please. i feel sort of romantic tonight.         it may interest physiologists to learn, at this point, that i have the abilitya most singular case, i presumeof shedding torrents of tears throughout the other tempest.                                             the brakes were relined, the waterpipes unclogged, the valves ground, and a number of other repairs and improvements were paid for by not very mechanicallyminded but prudent papa humbert, so that the late mrs. humberts car was in respectable shape when ready to undertake a new journey.         we had promised beardsley school, good old beardsley school, that we would be back as soon as my hollywood engagement came to an end inventive humbert was to be, i hinted, chief consultant in the production of a film dealing with existentialism, still a hot thing at the time. actually i was toying with the idea of gently trickling across the mexican borderi was braver now than last yearand there deciding what to do with my little concubine who was now sixty inches tall and weighed ninety pounds. we had dug out our tour books and maps. she had traced our route with immense zest. was it thanks to those theatricals that she had now outgrown her juvenile jaded airs and was so adorably keen to explore rich reality i experienced the queer lightness of dreams that pale but warm sunday morning when we abandoned professor chems puzzled house and sped along main street toward the fourlane highway. my loves striped, blackandwhite cotton frock, jauntry blue with the large beautifully cut aquamarine on a silver chainlet, which gemmed her throat a spring rain gift from me. we passed the new hotel, and she laughed. a penny for your thoughts, i said and she stretched out her palm at once, but at that moment i had to apply the breaks rather abruptly at a red light. as we pulled up, another car came to a gliding stop alongside, and a very striking looking, athletically lean young woman where had i seen her with a high complexion and shoulderlength brilliant bronze hair, greeted lo with a ringing hiand then, addressing me, effusively, edusively placed, stressing certain words, said what a          shameto was to          teardolly away from the playyou should have          heardthe author          ravingabout her after that rehearsal green light, you dope, said lo under her breath, and simultaneously, waving in bright adieu a bangled arm, joan of arc in a performance we saw at the local theatre violently outdistanced us to swerve into campus avenue.         who was it exactly vermont or rumpelmeyer         noedusa goldthe gal who coaches us.         i was not referring to her. who exactly concocted that play         oh yes, of course. some old woman, clare something, i guess. there was quite a crowd of them there.         so she complimented you         complimented my eyeshe kissed me on my pure browand my darling emitted that new yelp of merriment whichperhaps in connection with her theatrical mannerismsshe had lately begun to affect.         you are a funny creature, lolita, i saidor some such words. naturally, i am overjoyed you gave up that absurd stage business. but what is curious is that you dropped the whole thing only a week before its natural climax. oh, lolita, you should be careful of those surrenders of yours. i remember you gave up ramsdale for camp, and camp for a joyride, and i could list other abrupt changes in your disposition. you must be careful. there are things that should never be given up. you must persevere. you should try to be a little nicer to me, lolita. you should also watch your diet. the tour of your thigh, you know, should not exceed seventeen and a half inches. more might be fatal i was kidding, of course. we are now setting out on a long happy journey. i remember                                             i remember as a child in europe gloating over a map of north america that had appalachian mountains boldly running from alabama up to new brunswick, so that the whole region they spannedtennessee, the virginias, pennsylvania, new york, vermont, new hampshire and maine, appeared to my imagination as a gigantic switzerland or even tibet, all mountain, glorious diamond peak upon peak, giant conifers,          le montagnard migrin his bear skin glory, and          felis tigris goldsmithi, and red indians under the catalpas. that it all boiled down to a measly suburban lawn and a smoking garbage incinerator, was appalling. farewell, appalachia leaving it, we crossed ohio, the three states beginning with i, and nebraskaah, that first whiff of the west we traveled very leisurely, having more than a week to reach wace, continental divide, where she passionately desired to see he ceremonial dances marking the seasonal opening of magic cave, and at least three weeks to reach elphinstone, gem of a western state where she yearned to climb red rock from which a mature screen star had recently jumped to her death after a drunken row with her gigolo.         again we were welcomed to wary motels by means of inscriptions that read         we wish you feel at home while here.          allequipment was carefully checked upon your arrival. your license number is on record here. use hot water sparingly. we reserve the right to eject without notice any objectionable person. do not throw waste material of          anykind in the toilet bowl. thank you. call again. the management. p.s. we consider our guests the finest people of the world.         in these frightening places we paid ten for twins, flies queued outside at the screenless door and successfully scrambled in, the ashes of our predecessors still lingered in the ashtrays, a womans hair lay on the pillow, one heard ones neighbor hanging his coat in his closet, the hangers were ingeniously fixed to their bars by coils of wire so as to thwart theft, and, in crowning insult, the pictures above the twin beds were identical twins. i also noticed that commercial fashion was changing. there was a tendency for cabins to fuse and gradually form the caravansary, and, lo she was not interested but the reader may be, a second story was added, and a lobby grew in, and cars were removed to a communal garage, and the motel reverted to the good old hotel.         i now warn the reader not to mock me and my mental daze. it is easy for him and me to decipher          nowa past destiny but a destiny in the making is, believe me, not one of those honest mystery stories where all you have to do is keep an eye on the clues. in my youth i once read a french detective tale where the clues were actually in italics but that is not mcfates wayeven if one does learn to recognize certain obscure indications.         for instance i would not swear that there was not at least one occasion, prior to, or at the very beginning of, the midwest lap of our journey, when she managed to convey some information to, or otherwise get into contact with, a person or persons unknown. we had stopped at a gas station, under the sign of pegasus, and she had slipped out of her seat and escaped to the rear of the premises while the raised hood, under which i had bent to watch the mechanics manipulations, hid her for a moment from my sight. being inclined to be lenient, i only shook my benign head though strictly speaking such visits were taboo, since i felt instinctively that toiletsas also telephoneshappened to be, for reasons unfathomable, the points where my destiny was liable to catch. we all have such fateful objectsit may be a recurrent landscape in one case, a number in anothercarefully chosen by the gods to attract events of special significance for us here shall john always stumble there shall janes heart always break.         wellmy car had been attended to, and i had moved it away from the pumps to let a pickup truck be servicedwhen the growing volume of her absence began to weigh upon me in the windy grayness. not for the first time, and not for the last, had i stared in such dull discomfort of mind at those stationary trivialities that look almost surprised, like staring rustics, to find themselves in the stranded travelers field of vision that green garbage can, those very black, very whitewalled tires for sale, those bright cans of motor oil, that red icebox with assorted drinks, the four, five, seven discarded bottles within the incompleted crossword puzzle of their wooden cells, that bug patiently walking up the inside of the window of the office. radio music was coming from its open door, and because the rhythm was not synchronized with the heave and flutter and other gestures of windanimated vegetation, one had the impression of an old scenic film living its own life while piano or fiddle followed a line of music quite outside the shivering flower, the swaying branch. the sound of charlottes last sob incongruously vibrated through me as, with her dress fluttering athwart the rhythm, lolita veered from a totally unexpected direction. she had found the toilet occupied and had crossed over to the sign of the conche in the next block. they said there they were proud of their homeclean restrooms. these prepaid postcards, they said, had been provided for your comments. no postcards. no soap. nothing. no comments.         that day or the next, after a tedious drive through a land of food crops, we reached a pleasant little burg and put up at chestnut courtnice cabins, damp green grounds, apple trees, an old swingand a tremendous sunset which the tried child ignored. she had wanted to go through kasbeam because it was only thirty miles north from her home town but on the following morning i found her quite listless, with no desire to see again the sidewalk where she had played hopscotch some five years before. for obvious reasons i had rather dreaded that side trip, even though we had agreed not to make ourselves conspicuous in any wayto remain in the car and not look up old friends. my relief at her abandoning the project was spoiled by the thought that had she felt i were totally against the nostalgic possibilities of pisky, as i had been last year, she would not have given up so easily. on my mentioning this with a sigh, she sighed too and complained of being out of sorts. she wanted to remain in bed till teatime at least, with lots of magazines, and then if she felt better she suggested we just continue westward. i must say she was very sweet and languid, and craved for fresh fruits, and i decided to go and fetch her a toothsome picnic lunch in kasbeam. our cabin stood on the timbered crest of a hill, and from our window you could see the road winding down, and then running as straight as a hair parting between two rows of chestnut trees, towards the pretty town, which looked singularly distinct and toylike in the pure morning distance. one could make out an elflike girl on an insectlike bicycle, and a dog, a bit too large proportionately, all as clear as those pilgrims and mules winding up waxpale roads in old paintings with blue hills and red little people. i have the european urge to use my feet when a drive can be dispensed with, so i leisurely walked down, eventually meeting the cyclista plain plump girl with pigtails, followed by a huge st. bernard dog with orbits like pansies. in kasbeam a very old barber gave me a very mediocre haircut he babbled of a baseballplaying son of his, and, at every explodent, spat into my neck, and every now and then wiped his glasses on my sheetwrap, or interrupted his tremulous scissor work to produce faded newspaper clippings, and so inattentive was i that it came as a shock to realize as he pointed to an easeled photograph among the ancient gray lotions, that the mustached young ball player had been dead for the last thirty years.         i had a cup of hot flavorless coffee, bought a bunch of bananas for my monkey, and spent another ten minutes or so in a delicatessen store. at least an hour and a half must have elapsed when this homewardbound little pilgrim appeared on the winding road leading to chestnut castle.         the girl i had seen on my way to town was now loaded with linen and engaged in helping a misshapen man whose big head and coarse features reminded me of the bertoldo character in low italian comedy. they were cleaning the cabins of which there was a dozen or so on chestnut crest, all pleasantly spaced amid the copious verdure. it was noon, and most of them, with a final bang of their screen doors, had already got rid of their occupants. a very elderly, almost mummylike couple in a very new model were in the act of creeping out of one of the contiguous garages from another a red hood protruded in somewhat codpiece fashion and nearer to our cabin, a strong and handsome young man with a shock of black hair and blue eyes was putting a portable refrigerator into a station wagon. for some reason he gave me a sheepish grin as i passed. on the grass expanse opposite, in the manylimbed hsade of luxuriant trees, the familiar st. bernard dog was guarding his mistress bicycle, and nearby a young woman, far gone in the family way, had seated a rapt baby on a swing and was rocking it gently, while a jealous boy of two or three was making a nuisance of himself by trying to push or pull the swing board he finally succeeded in getting himself knocked down by it, and bawled loudly as he lay supine on the grass while his mother continued to smile gently at neither of her present children. i recall so clearly these miniatiae probably because i was to check my impressions so thoroughly only a few minutes later and besides, something in me had been on guard ever since that awful night in beardsley. i now refused to be diverted by the feeling of wellbeing that my walk had engenderedby the young summer breeze that enveloped the nape of my neck, the giving crrunch of the damn gravel, the juice tidbit. i had sucked out at last from a hollowy tooth, and even the comfortable weight of my provisions which the general condition of my heart should not have allowed me to carry but even that miserable pump of mine seemed to be working sweetly, and i felt          adolori damoureuse langueur, to quote dear old ronsard, as i reached the cottage where i had left my dolores.         to my surprise i found her dressed. she was sitting on the edge of the bed in slacks and tshirt, and was looking at me as if she could not quite place me. the frank soft shape of her small breasts was brought out rather than blurred by the limpness of her thin shirt, and this frankness irritated me. she had not washed yet her mouth was freshly though smudgily painted, and her broad teeth glistened like winetinged ivory, or pinkish poker chips. and there she sat, hands clasped in her lap, and dreamily brimmed with a diabolical glow that had no relations to me whatever.         i plumped down my heavy paper bag and stood staring at the bare ankles of her sandaled feet, then at her silly face, then again at her sinful feet. youve been out, i said the sandals were filthy with gravel.         i just got up, she replied, and added upon intercepting my downward glance went out for a sec. wanted to see if you were coming back.         she became aware of the bananas and uncoiled herself tableward.         what special suspicion could i have none indeedbut those muddy, moony eyes of hers, that singular warmth emanating from her i said nothing. i looked at the road meandering so distinctly within the frame of the window anybody wishing to betray my trust would have found it a splendid lookout. with rising appetite, lo applied herself to the fruit. all at once i remembered the ingratiating grin of the johnny next door. i stepped out quickly. all cars had disappeared except his station wagon his pregnant young wife was not getting into it with her baby and the other, more or less canceled, child.         whats the matter, where are you going cried lo from the porch.         i said nothing. i pushed her softness back into the room and went in after her. i ripped her shirt off. i unzipped the rest of her, i tore off her sandals. wildly, i pursued the shadow of her infidelity but the scent i traveled upon was so slight as to be practically undistinguishable from a madmans fancy.                                                      grosgaston, in his prissy way, had liked to make presentspresents just a prissy wee bit out of the ordinary, or so he prissily thought. noticing one night that my box of chessmen was broken, he sent me next morning, with a little lad of his, a copper case it had an elaborate oriental design over the lid and could be securely locked. once glance sufficed to assure me that it was one of those cheap money boxes called for some reason luizettas that you buy in algiers and elsewhere, and wonder what to do with afterwards. it turned out to be much too flat for holding my bulky chessmen, but i kept itusing it for a totally different purpose.         in order to break some pattern of fate in which i obscurely felt myself being enmeshed, i had decideddespite los visible annoyanceto spend another night at chestnut court definitely waking up at four in the morning, i ascertained that lo was still sound asleep mouth open, in a kind of dull amazement at the curiously inane life we all had rigged up for her and satisfied myself that the precious contents of the luizetta were safe. there, snugly wrapped in a white woolen scarf, lay a pocket automatic caliber ., capacity of magazine  cartridges, length a little under one ninth of lolitas length, stock checked walnut, finish full blued. i had inherited it from the late harold haze, with a  catalog which cheerily said in part particularly well adapted for use in the home and car as well as on the person. there it lay, ready for instant service on the person or persons, loaded and fully cocked with the slide lock in safety position, thus precluding any accidental discharge. we must remember that a pistol is the freudian symbol of the urfathers central forelimb.         i was now glad i had it with meand even more glad that i had learned to use it two years before, in the pine forest around my and charlottes glass lake. farlow, with whom i had roamed those remote woods, was an admirable marksman, and with his . actually managed to hit a hummingbird, though i must say not much of it could be retrieved for proofonly a little iridescent fluff. a burley expoliceman called krestovski, who in the twenties had shot and killed two escaped convicts, joined us and bagged a tiny woodpeckercompletely out of season, incidentally. between those two sportsmen i of course was a novice and kept missing everything, though i did would a squirrel on a later occasion when i went out alone. you like here, i whispered to my lightweight compact little chum, and then toasted it with a dram of gin.                                             the reader must now forget chestnuts and colts, and accompany us further west. the following days were marked by a number of great thunderstormsor perhaps, thee was but one single storm which progressed across country in ponderous frogleaps and which we could not shake off just as we could not shake off detective trapp for it was during those days that the problem of the aztec red convertible presented itself to me, and quite overshadowed the theme of los lovers.         queer i who was jealous of every male we metqueer, how i misinterpreted the designations of doom. perhaps i had been lulled by los modest behavior in winter, and anyway it would have been too foolish even for a lunatic to suppose another humbert was avidly following humbert and humberts nymphet with jovian fireworks, over the great and ugly plains. i surmised,          donc, that the red yak keeping behind us at a discreet distance mile after mile was operated by a detective whom some busybody had hired to see what exactly humbert humbert was doing with that minor stepdaughter of his. as happens with me at periods of electrical disturbance and crepitating lightnings, i had hallucinations. maybe they were more than hallucinations. i do not know what she or he, or both had put into my liquor but one night i felt sure somebody was tapping on the door of our cabin, and i flung it open, and noticed two thingsthat i was stark naked and that, whiteglistening in the raindripping darkness, there stood a man holding before his face the mask of jutting chin, a grotesque sleuth in the funnies. he emitted a muffled guffaw and scurried away, and i reeled back into the room, and fell asleep again, and am not sure even to this day that the visit was not a drugprovoked dream i have thoroughly studied trapps type of humor, and this might have been a plausible sample. oh, crude and absolutely ruthless somebody, i imagined, was making money on those masks of popular monsters and morons. did i see next morning two urchins rummaging in a garbage can and trying on jutting chin i wonder. it may all have been a coincidencedue to atmospheric conditions, i suppose.         being a murderer with a sensational but incomplete and unorthodox memory, i cannot tell you, ladies and gentlemen, the exact day when i first knew with utter certainty that the red convertible was following us. i do remember, however, the first time i saw its driver quite clearly. i was proceeding slowly one afternoon through torrents of rain and kept seeing that red ghost swimming and shivering with lust in my mirror, when presently the deluge dwindled to a patter, and then was suspended altogether. with a swishing sound a sunburst swept the highway, and needing a pair of new sunglasses, i pussled up at a filling station. what was happening was a sickness, a cancer, that could not be helped, so i simply ignored the fact that our quiet pursuer, in his converted state, stopped a little behind us at a cafe or bar bearing the idiotic sign the bustle a deceitful seatful. having seen to the needs of my car, i walked into the office to get those glasses and pay for the gas. as i was in the act of signing a travelers check and wondered about my exact whereabouts, i happened to glance through a side window, and saw a terrible thing. a broadbacked man, baldish, in an oatmeal coat and darkbrown trousers, was listening to lo who was leaning out of the car and talking to him very rapidly, her hand with outspread fingers going up and down as it did when she was very serious and emphatic. what struck me with sickening force washow should i put itthe voluble familiarity of her way, as if they had known each otheroh, for weeks and weeks. i saw him scratch his cheek and nod, and turn, and walk back to his convertible, a broad and thickish man of my age, somewhat resembling gustave trapp, a cousin of my fathers in switzerlandsame smoothly tanned face, fuller than mine, with a small dark mustache and a rosebud degenerate mouth. lolita was studying a road map when i got back into the car.         what did that man ask you, lol         man oh, that man. oh yes. oh, i dont know. he wondered if i had a map. lost his way, i guess.         we drove on, and i said         now listen, lo. i do not know whether you are lying or not, and i do not know whether you are insane or not, and i do not care for the moment but that person has been following us all day, and his car was at the motel yesterday, and i think he is a cop. you know perfectly well what will happen and where you will go if the police find out about things. now i want to know exactly what he said to you and what you told him.         she laughed.         if hes really a cop, she said shrilly but not illogically, the worst thing we could do, would be to show him we are scared. ignore him,          dad.         did he ask where we were going         oh, he knows          that mocking me.         anyway, i said, giving up, i have seen his face now. he is not pretty. he looks exactly like a relative of mine called trapp.         perhaps he is trapp. if i were youoh, look, all the nines are changing into the next thousand. when i was a little kid, she continued unexpectedly, i used to think theyd stop and go back to nines, if only my mother agreed to put the car in reverse.         it was the first time, i think, she spoke spontaneously of her prehumbertian childhood perhaps, the theatre had taught her that trick and silently we traveled on, unpursued.         but next day, like pain in a fatal disease that comes back as the drug and hope wear off, there it was again behind us, that glossy red beast. the traffic on the highway was light that day nobody passed anybody and nobody attempted to get in between our humble blue car and its imperious red shadowas if there were some spell cast on that interspace, a zone of evil mirth and magic, a zone whose very precision and stability had a glasslike virtue that was almost artistic. the driver behind me, with his stuffed shoulders and trappish mustache, looked like a display dummy, and his convertible seemed to move only because an invisible rope of silent silk connected it with out shabby vehicle. we were many times weaker than his splendid, lacquered machine, so that i did not even attempt to outspeed him.          o lente currite noctis equio softly run, nightmares we climbed long grades and rolled downhill again, and heeded speed limits, and spared slow children, and reproduced in sweeping terms the black wiggles of curves on their yellow shields, and no matter how and where we drove, the enchanted interspace slid on intact, mathematical, miragelike, the viatic counterpart of a magic carpet. and all the time i was aware of a private blaze on my right her joyful eye, her flaming cheek.         a traffic policeman, deep in the nightmare of crisscross streetsat halfpastfour p.m. in a factory townwas the hand of chance that interrupted the spell. he beckoned me on, and then with the same hand cut off my shadow. a score of cars were launched in between us, and i sped on, and deftly turned into a narrow lane. a sparrow alighted with a jumbo bread crumb, was tackled by another, and lost the crumb.         when after a few grim stoppages and a bit of deliberate meandering, i returned to the highway, our shadow had disappeared.         lola snorted and said if he is what you think he is, how silly to give him the slip.         i have other notions by now, i said.         you shouldahcheck them byahkeeping in touch with him, fahther deah, said lo, writhing in the coils of her own sarcasm. gee, you          aremean, she added in her ordinary voice.         we spent a grim night in a very foul cabin, under a sonorous amplitude of rain, and with a kind of prehistorically loud thunder incessantly rolling above us.         i am not a lady and do not like lightning, said lo, whose dread of electric storms gave me some pathetic solace.         we had breakfast in the township of soda, pop. .         judging by the terminal figure, i remarked, fatface is already here.         your humor, said lo, is sidesplitting, deah fahther.         we were in sagebrush country by that time, and there was a day or two of lovely release i had been a fool, all was well, that discomfort was merely a trapped flatus, and presently the mesas gave way to real mountains, and, on time, we drove into wace.         oh, disaster. some confusion had occurred, she had misread a date in the tour book, and the magic cave ceremonies were over she took it bravely, i must admitand, when we discovered there was in jurortish wace a summer theatre in full swing, we naturally drifted toward it one fair midjune evening. i really could not tell you the plot of the play we saw. a trivial affair, no doubt, with selfconscious light effects and a mediocre leading lady. the only detail that pleased me was a garland of seven little graces, more or less immobile, prettily painted, barelimbedseven bemused pubescent girls in colored gauze that had been recruited locally judging by the partisan flurry here and there among the audience and were supposed to represent a living rainbow, which lingered throughout the last act, and rather teasingly faded behind a series of multiplied veils. i remember thinking that this idea of childrencolors had been lifted by authors clare quilty and vivian darkbloom from a passage in james joyce, and that two of the colors were quite exasperatingly lovelyorange who kept fidgeting all the time, and emerald who, when her eyes got used to the pitchblack pit where we all heavily sat, suddenly smiled at her mother or her protector.         as soon as the thing was over, and manual applausea sound my nerves cannot standbegan to crash all around me, i started to pull and push lo toward the exit, in my so natural amorous impatience to get her back to our neonblue cottage in the stunned, starry night i always say nature is stunned by the sights she sees. dollylo, however, lagged behind, in a rosy daze, her pleased eyes narrowed, her sense of vision swamping the rest of her senses to such an extent that her limp hands hardly came together at all in the mechanical action of clapping they still went through. i had seen that kind of thing in children before but, by god, this was a special child, myopically beaming at the already remote stage where i glimpsed something of the joint authorsa mans tuxedo and the bare shoulders of a hawklike, blackhaired, strikingly tall woman.         youve again hurt my wrist, you brute, said lolita in a small voice as she slipped into her car seat.         i am dreadfully sorry, my darling, my own ultraviolet darling, i said, unsuccessfully trying to catch her elbow, and i added, to change the conversationto change the direction of fate, oh god, oh god vivian is quite a woman. i am sure we saw her yesterday in that restaurant, in soda pop.         sometimes, said lo, you are quite revoltingly dumb. first, vivian is the male author, the gal author is clare and second, she is forty, married and has negro blood.         i thought, i said kidding her, quilty was an ancient flame of yours, in the days when you loved me, in sweet old ramsdale.         what countered lo, her features working. that fat dentist you must be confusing me with some other fast little article.         and i thought to myself how those fast little articles forget everything, everything, while we, old lovers, treasure every inch of their nymphancy.                                             with los knowledge and assent, the two post offices given to the beardsley postmaster as forwarding addresses were p.o. wace and p.o. elphinstone. next morning we visited the former and had to wait in a short but slow queue. serene lo studied the rogues gallery. handsome bryan bryanski, alias anthony bryan, alias tony brown, eyes hazel, complexion fair, was wanted for kidnapping. a sadeyed old gentlemans fauxpas was mail fraud, and, as if that were not enough, he was cursed with deformed arches. sullen sullivan came with a caution is believed armed, and should be considered extremely dangerous. if you want to make a movie out of my book, have one of these faces gently melt into my own, while i look. and moreover there was a smudgy snapshot of a missing girl, age fourteen, wearing brown shoes when last seen, rhymes. please notify sheriff buller.         i forget my letters as to dollys, there was her report and a very speciallooking envelope. this i deliberately opened and perused its contents. i concluded i was doing the foreseen since she did not seem to mind and drifted toward the newsstand near the exit.         dollylo well, the play was a grand success. all three hounds lay quiet having been slightly drugged by cutler, i suspect, and linda knew all your lines. she was fine, she had alertness and control, but lacked somehow the          responsiveness,the          relaxed vitality,the charm of          myand the authorsdiana but there was no author to applaud us as last time, and the terrific electric storm outside interfered with our own modest offstage thunder. oh dear, life does fly. now that everything is over, school, play, the roy mess, mothers confinement our baby, alas, did not live, it all seems such a long time ago, though practically i still bear traces of the paint.         we are going to new york after tomorrow, and i guess i cant manage to wriggle out of accompanying my parents to europe. i have even worse news for you. dollylo i may not be back at beardsley if and when you return. with one thing and another, one being you know who, and the other not being who you think you know, dad wants me to go to school in paris for one year while he and fullbright are around.         as expected, poor poet stumbled in scene iii when arriving at the bit of french nonsense. remember          ne manque pas de dire ton amant, chimne, comme le lac         est         beau car il faut quil ty mne.lucky beau          quil tywhat a tonguetwister well, be good, lollikins. best love from your poet, and best regards to the governor. your mona. p.s. because of one thing and another, my correspondence happens to be rigidly controlled. so better wait till i write you from europe. she never did as far as i know. the letter contained an element of mysterious nastiness that i am too tired today to analyze. i found it later preserved in one of the tour books, and give it here          titre documentaire. i read it twice.         i looked up from the letter and was about tothere was no lo to behold. while i was engrossed in monas witchery, lo had shrugged her shoulders and vanished. did you happen to see i asked of a hunchback sweeping the floor near the entrance. he had, the old lecherer. he guessed she had seen a friend and had hurried out. i hurried out too. i stoppedshe had not. i hurried on. i stopped again. it had happened at last. she had gone for ever.         in later years i have often wondered why she did          notgo forever that day. was it the retentive quality of her new summer clothes in my locked car was it some unripe particle in some general plan was it simply because, all things considered, i might as well be used to convey her to elphinstonethe secret terminus, anyway i only know i was quite certain she had left me for ever. the noncommittal mauve mountains half encircling the town seemed to me to swarm with panting, scrambling, laughing, panting lolitas who dissolved in their haze. a big w made of white stones on a steep talus in the far vista of a cross street seemed the very initial of woe.         the new and beautiful post office i had just emerged from stood between a dormant movie house and a conspiracy of poplars. the time was  a.m. mountain time. the street was charming it into beauty, was one of those fragile young summer mornings with flashes of glass here and there and a general air of faltering and almost fainting at the prospect of an intolerably torrid noon. crossing over, i loafed and leafed, as it were, through one long block drugs, real estate, fashions, auto parts, cafe, sporting goods, real estate, furniture, appliances, western union, cleaners, grocery. officer, officer, my daughter has run away. in collusion with a detective in love with a blackmailer. took advantage of my utter helplessness. i peered into all the stores. i deliberated inly if i should talk to any of the sparse footpassengers. i did not. i sat for a while in the parked car. i inspected the public garden on the east side. i went back to fashions and auto parts. i told myself with a burst of furious sarcasm          un ricanementthat i was crazy to suspect her, that she would turn up any minute.         she did.         i wheeled around and shook off the hand she had placed on my sleeve with a timid and imbecile smile.         get into the car, i said.         she obeyed, and i went on pacing up and down, struggling with nameless thoughts, trying to plan some way of tackling her duplicity.         presently she left the car and was at my side again. my sense of hearing gradually got tuned in to station lo again, and i became aware she was telling me that she had met a former girl friend.         yes whom         a beardsley girl.         good. i now every name in your group. alice adams         the girl was not in my group.         good. i have a complete student list with me. her name please.         she was not in my school she is just a town girl in beardsley.         good. i have the beardsley directory with me too. well look up all the browns.         i only know her first name.         mary or jane         nodolly, like me.         so thats the dead end the mirror you break your nose against. good. let us try another angle. you have been absent twentyeight minutes. what did the two dollys do         we went to a drugstore.         and you had there         oh, just a couple of cokes.         careful, dolly. we can check that, you know.         at least, she had. i had a glass of water.         good. was it that place there         sure.         good, come on, well grill the soda jerk.         wait a sec. come to think it might have been further downjust around the corner.         come on all the same. go in please. well, lets see. opening a chained telephone book. dignified funeral service. no, not yet. here we are druggistsretail. hill drug store. larkins pharmacy. and two more. thats all wace seems to have in the way of soda fountainsat least in the business section. well, we will check them all.         go to hell, she said.         lo, rudeness will get you nowhere.         okay, she said. but youre not going to trap me. okay, so we did not have a pop. we just talked and looked at dresses in show windows.         which that window there for example         yes, that one there, for example.         oh lo lets look closer at it.         it was indeed a pretty sight. a dapper young fellow was vacuumcleaning a carpet upon which stood two figures that looked as if some blast had just worked havoc with them. one figure was stark naked, wigless and armless. its comparatively small stature and smirking pose suggested that when clothed it had represented, and would represent when clothed again, a girlchild of lolitas size. but in its present state it was sexless. next to it, stood a much taller veiled bride, quite perfect and          intactaexcept for the lack of one arm. on the floor, at the feet of these damsels, where the man crawled about laboriously with his cleaner, there lay a cluster of three slender arms, and a blond wig. two of the arms happened to be twisted and seemed to suggest a clasping gesture of horror and supplication.         look, lo, i said quietly. look well. is not that a rather good symbol of something or other howeveri went on as we got back into the cari have taken certain precautions. here delicately opening the glove compartment, on this pad i have our boy friends car number.         as the ass i was i had not memorized it. what remained of it in my mind were the initial letter and the closing figure as if the whole amphitheater of six signs receded concavely behind a tinted glass too opaque to allow the central series to be deciphered, but just translucent enough to make out its extreme edgesa capital p and a . i have to go into those details which in themselves can interest only a professional psychologue because otherwise the reader ah, if i could visualize him as a blondbearded scholar with rosy lips sucking          la pomme de sa canneas he quaffs my manuscript might not understand the quality of the shock i experienced upon noticing that the p had acquired the bustle of a b and that the  had been deleted altogether. the rest, with erasures revealing the hurried shuttle smear of a pencils rubber end, and with parts of numbers obliterated or reconstructed in a childs hand, presented a tangle of barbed wire to any logical interpretation. all i knew was the stateone adjacent to the state beardsley was in.         i said nothing. i put the pad back, closed the compartment, and drove out of wace. lo had grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobilewhitebloused, one brown elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or clown. three or four miles out of wace, i turned into the shadow of a picnic ground where the morning had dumped its litter of light on an empty table lo looked up with a semismile of surprise and without a word i delivered a tremendous backhand cut that caught her smack on her hot hard little cheekbone.         and then the remorse, the poignant sweetness of sobbing atonement, groveling love, the hopelessness of sensual reconciliation. in the velvet night, at mirana motel mirana i kissed the yellowish soles of her longtoed feet, i immolated myself but it was all of no avail. both doomed were we. and soon i was to enter a new cycle of persecution.         in a street of wace, on its outskirts oh, i am quite sure it was not a delusion. in a street of wace, i had glimpsed the aztec red convertible, or its identical twin. instead of trapp, it contained four or five loud young people of several sexesbut i said nothing. after wace a totally new situation arose. for a day or two, i enjoyed the mental emphasis with which i told myself that we were not, and never had been followed and then i became sickeningly conscious that trapp had changed his tactics and was still with us, in this or that rented car.         a veritable proteus of the highway, with bewildering ease he switched from one vehicle to another. this technique implied the existence of garages specializing in stageautomobile operations, but i never could discover the remises he used. he seemed to patronize at first the chevrolet genus, beginning with a campus cream convertible, then going on to a small horizon blue sedan, and thenceforth fading into surf gray and driftwood gray. then he turned to other makes and passed through a pale dull rainbow of paint shades, and one day i found myself attempting to cope with the subtle distinction between our own dream blue melmoth and the crest blue oldsmobile he had rented grays, however, remained his favorite cryptochromism, and, in agonizing nightmares, i tried in vain to sort out properly such ghosts as chryslers shell gray, chevrolets thistle gray, dodges french gray         the necessity of being constantly on the lookout for his little mustache and open shirtor for his baldish pate and broad shouldersled me to a profound study of all cars on the roadbehind, before, alongside, coming, going, every vehicle under the dancing sun the quiet vacationists automobile with the box of tendertouch tissues in the back window the recklessly speeding jalopy full of pale children with a shaggy dogs head protruding, and a crumpled mudguard the bachelors tudor sedan crowded with suits on hangers the huge fat house trailer weaving in front, immune to the indian file of fury boiling behind it the car with the young female passenger politely perched in the middle of the front seat to be closer to the young male driver the car carrying on its roof a red boat bottom up the gray car slowing up before us, the gray car catching up with us.         we were in mountain country, somewhere between snow and champion, and rolling down an almost imperceptible grade, when i had my next distinct view of detective paramour trapp. the gray mist behind us had deepened and concentrated into the compactness of a dominion blue sedan. all of a sudden, as if the car i drove responded to my poor hearts pangs, we were slithering from side to side, with something making a helpless plapplapplap under us.         you got a flat, mister, said cheerful lo.         i pulled upnear a precipice. she folded her arms and put her foot on the dashboard. i got out and examined the right rear wheel. the base of its tire was sheepishly and hideously square. trapp had stopped some fifty yards behind us. his distant face formed a grease spot of mirth. this was my chance. i started to walk towards himwith the brilliant idea of asking him for a jack through i had one. he backed a little. i stubbed my toe against a stoneand there was a sense of general laughter. then a tremendous truck loomed from behind trapp and thundered by meand immediately after, i heard it utter a convulsive honk. instinctively i looked backand saw my own car gently creeping away. i could make out lo ludicrously at the wheel, and the engine was certainly runningthough i remembered i had cut it but had not applied the emergency brake and during the brief space of throbtime that it took me to reach the croaking machine which came to a standstill at last, it dawned upon me that during the last two years little lo had had ample time to pick up the rudiments of driving. as i wrenched the door open, i was goddam sure she had started the car to prevent me from walking up to trapp. her trick proved useless, however, for even while i was puruing her he had made an energetic uturn and was gone. i rested for a while. lo asked wasnt i going to thank herthe car had started to move by itself andgetting no answer, she immersed herself in a study of the map. i got out again and commenced the ordeal of the orb, as charlotte used to say. perhaps, i was losing my mind.         we continued our grotesque journey. after a forlorn and useless dip, we went up and up. on a steep grade i found myself behind the gigantic truck that had overtaken us. it was now groaning up a winding road and was impossible to pass. out of its front part a small oblong of smooth silverthe inner wrapping of chewing gumescaped and flew back into our windshield. it occurred to me that if i were really losing my mind, i might end by murdering somebody. in factsaid highanddry humbert to floundering humbertit might be quite clever to prepare thingsto transfer the weapon from box to pocketso as to be ready to take advantage of the spell of insanity when it does come.                                             by permitting lolita to study acting i had, fond fool, suffered her to cultivate deceit. it now appeared that it had not been merely a matter of learning the answers to such questions as what is the basic conflict in hedda gabler, or where are the climaxes in love under the lindens, or analyze the prevailing mood of cherry orchard it was really a matter of learning to betray me. how i deplored now the exercises in sensual simulation that i had so often seen her go through in our beardsley parlor when i would observe her from some strategic point while she, like a hypnotic subject of a performer in a mystic rite, produced sophisticated version of infantile makebelieve by going through the mimetic actions of hearing a moan in the dark, seeing for the first time a brand new young stepmother, tasting something she hated, such as buttermilk, smelling crushed grass in a lush orchard, or touching mirages of objects with her sly, slender, girlchild hands. among my papers i still have a mimeographed sheet suggesting         tactile drill. imagine yourself picking up and holding a pingpong ball, an apple, a sticky date, a new flannelfluffed tennis ball, a hot potato, an ice cube, a kitten, a puppy, a horseshoe, a feather, a flashlight.         knead with your fingers the following imaginary things a piece of brad, india rubber, a friends aching temple, a sample of velvet, a rose petal.         you are a blind girl. palpate the face of a greek youth, cyrano, santa claus, a baby, a laughing faun, a sleeping stranger, your father.         but she had been so pretty in the weaving of those delicate spells, in the dreamy performance of her enchantments and duties on certain adventurous evenings, in beardsley, i also had her dance for me with the promise of some treat or gift, and although these routine legparted leaps of hers were more like those of a football cheerleader than like the languorous and jerky motions of a parisian          petit rat, the rhythms of her not quite nubile limbs had given me pleasure. but all that was nothing, absolutely nothing, to the indescribable itch of rapture that her tennis game produced in methe teasing delirious feeling of teetering on the very brink of unearthly order and splendor.         despite her advanced age, she was more of a nymphet than ever, with her apricotcolored limbs, in her subteen tennis togs winged gentlemen no hereafter is acceptable if it does not produce her as she was then, in that colorado resort between snow and elphinstone, with everything right the white wide littleboy shorts, the slender waist, the apricot midriff, the white breastkerchief whose ribbons went up and encircled her neck to end behind in a dangling knot leaving bare her gaspingly young and adorable apricot shoulder blades with that pubescence and those lovely gentle bones, and the smooth, downwardtapering back. her cap had a white peak. her racket had cost me a small fortune. idiot, triple idiot i could have filmed her i would have had her now with me, before my eyes, in the projection room of my pain and despair         she would wait and relax for a bar or two of whitelined time before going into the act of serving, and often bounced the ball once or twice, or pawed the ground a little, always at ease, always rather vague about the score, always cheerful as she so seldom was in the dark life she led at home. her tennis was the highest point to which i can imagine a young creature bringing the art of makebelieve, although i dareseay, for her it was the very geometry of basic reality.         the exquisite clarity of all her movements had its auditory counterpart in the pure ringing sound of her every stroke. the ball when it entered her aura of control became somehow whiter, its resilience somehow richer, and the instrument of precision she used upon it seemed inordinately prehensile and deliberate at the moment of clinging contact. her form was, indeed, an absolutely perfect imitation of absolutely topnotch tenniswithout any utilitarian results. as edusas sister, electra gold, a marvelous young coach, said to me once while i sat on a pulsating hard bench watching dolores haze toying with linda hall and being beaten by her dolly has a magnet in the center of her racket guts, but why the heck is she so polite ah, electra, what did it matter, with such grace i remember at the very first game i watched being drenched with an almost painful convulsion of beauty assimilation. my lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at the ample and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop and hang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot, pristine armpit, burnished arm and far backflung racket, as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at the small globe suspended so high in the zenith of the powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of falling upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip.         it had, that serve of hers, beauty, directness, youth, a classical purity of trajectory, and was, despite its spanking pace, fairly easy to return, having as it did no twist or sting to its long elegant hop.         that i could have had all her strokes, all her enchantments, immortalized in segments of celluloid, makes me moan today with frustration. they would have been so much more than the snapshots i burned her overhead volley was related to her service as the envoy is to the ballade for she had been trained, my pet, to patter up at once to the net on her nimble, vivid, whiteshod feet. there was nothing to choose between her forehand and backhand drives they were mirror images of one anothermy very loins still tingle with those pistol reports repeated by crisp echoes and electras cries. one of the pearls of dollys game was a short halfvolley that ned litam had taught her in california.         she preferred acting to swimming, and swimming to tennis yet i insist that had not something within her been broken by menot that i realized it thenshe would have had on the top of her perfect form the will to win, and would have become a real girl champion. dolores, with two rackets under her arm, in wimbledon. dolores endorsing a dromedary. dolores turning professional. dolores acting a girl champion in a movie. dolores and her gray, humble, hushed husbandcoach, old humbert.         there was nothing wrong or deceitful in the spirit of her gameunless one considered her cheerful indifference toward its outcome as the feint of a nymphet. she who was so cruel and crafty in everyday life, revealed an innocence, a frankness, a kindness of ballplacing, that permitted a secondrate but determined player, no matter how uncouth and incompetent, to poke and cut his way to victory. despite her small stature, she covered the one thousand and fiftythree square feet of her half of the court with wonderful ease, once she had entered into the rhythm of a rally and as long as she could direct that rhythm but any abrupt attack, or sudden change of tactics on her adversarys part, left her helpless. at match point, her second serve, whichrather typicallywas even stronger and more stylish than her first for she had none of the inhibitions that cautious winners have, would strike vibrantly the hardcord of the netand ricochet out of court. the polished gem of her dropshot was snapped up and put away by an opponent who seemed fourlegged and wielded a crooked paddle. her dramatic drives and lovely volleys would candidly fall at his feet. over and over again she would land an easy one into the netand merrily mimic dismay by drooping in a ballet attitude, with her forelocks hanging. so sterile were her grace and whipper that she could not even win from panting me and my oldfashioned lifting drive.         i suppose i am especially susceptible to the magic of games. in my chess sessions with gaston i saw the board as a square pool of limpid water with rare shells and stratagems rosily visible upon the smooth tessellated bottom, which to my confused adversary was all ooze and squidcloud. similarly, the initial tennis coaching i had inflicted on lolitaprior to the revelations that came to her through the great californians lessonsremained in my mind as oppressive and distressful memoriesnot only because she had been so hopelessly and irritatingly irritated by every suggestion of minebut because the precious symmetry of the court instead of reflecting the harmonies latent in her was utterly jumbled by the clumsiness and lassitude of the resentful child i mistaught. now things were different, and on that particular day, in the pure air of champion, colorado, on that admirable court at the foot of seep stone stairs leading up to champion hotel where we had spent the night, i felt i could rest from the nightmare of unknown betrayals within the innocence of her style, of her soul, of her essential grace.         she was hitting hard and flat, with her usual effortless sweep, feeding me deep skimming ballsall so rhythmically coordinated and overt as to reduce my footwork to, practically, a swinging strollcrack players will understand what i mean. my rather heavily cut serve that i had been taught by my father who had learned it from decugis or borman, old friends of his and great champions, would have seriously troubled my lo, had i really tried to trouble her. but who would upset such a lucid dear did i ever mention that her bare arm bore the  of vaccination that i loved her hopelessly that she was only fourteen         an inquisitive butterfly passed, dipping, between us.         two people in tennis shorts, a redhaired fellow only about eight years my junior, and an indolent dark girl with a moody mouth and hard eyes, about two years lolitas senior, appeared from nowhere. as is common with dutiful tyros, their rackets were sheathed and framed, and they carried them not as if they were the natural and comfortable extensions of certain specialized muscles, but hammers or blunderbusses or whimbles, or my own dreadful cumbersome sins. rather unceremoniously seating themselves near my precious coat, on a bench adjacent to the court, they fell to admiring very vocally a rally of some fifty exchanges that lo innocently helped me to foster and upholduntil there occurred a syncope in the series causing her to gasp as her overhead smash went out of court, whereupon she melted into winsome merriment, my golden pet.         i felt thirsty by then, and walked to the drinking fountain there red approached me and in all humility suggested a mixed double. i am bill mead, he said. and thats fay page, actress. maffy on sayhe added pointing with his ridiculously hooded racket at polished fay who was already talking to dolly. i was about to reply sorry, but for i hate to have my filly involved in the chops and jabs of cheap bunglers, when a remarkably melodious cry diverted my attention a bellboy was tripping down the steps from the hotel to our court and making me signs. i was wanted, if you please, on an urgent long distance callso urgent in fact that the line was being held for me. certainly. i got into my coat inside pocket heavy with pistol and told lo i would be back in a minute. she was picking up a ballin the continental footracket way which was one of the few nice things i had taught her,and smiledshe smiled at me         an awful calm kept my heart afloat as i followed the boy up to the hotel. this, to use an american term, in which discovery, retribution, torture, death, eternity appear in the shape of a singularly repulsive nutshell, was          it. i had left her in mediocre hands, but it hardly mattered now. i would fight, of course. oh, i would fight. better destroy everything than surrender her. yes, quite a climb.         at the desk, dignified, romannosed man, with, i suggest, a very obscure past that might reward investigation, handed me a message in his own hand. the line had not been held after all. the note said         mr. humbert. the head of birdsley sic school called. summer residencebirdsley . please call back immediately. highly important.         i folded myself into a booth, took a little pill, and four about twenty minutes tussled with spacespooks. a quartet of propositions gradually became audible soprano, there was no such number in beardsley alto, miss pratt was on her way to england tenor, beardsley school had not telephoned bass, they could not have done so, since nobody knew i was, that particular day, in champion, colo. upon my stinging him, the roman took the trouble to find out if there had been a long distance call. there had been none. a fake call from some local dial was not excluded. i thanked him. he said you bet. after a visit to the purling mens room and a stiff drink at the bar, i started on my return march. from the very first terrace i saw, far below, on the tennis court which seemed the size of a school childs illwiped slate, golden lolita playing in a double. she moved like a fair angel among three horrible boschian cripples. one of these, her partner, while changing sides, jocosely slapped her on her behind with his racket. he had a remarkably round head and wore incongruous brown trousers. there was a momentary flurryhe saw me, and throwing away his racketminescuttled up the slope. he waved his wrists and elbows in a wouldbe comical imitation of rudimentary wings, as he climbed, blowlegged, to the street, where his gray car awaited him. next moment he and the grayness were gone. when i came down, the remaining trio were collecting and sorting out the balls.         mr. mead, who was that person         bill and fay, both looking very solemn, shook their heads.         that absurd intruder had butted in to make up a double, hadnt he, dolly         dolly. the handle of my racket was still disgustingly warm. before returning to the hotel, i ushered her into a little alley halfsmothered in fragrant shrubs, with flowers like smoke, and was about to burst into ripe sobs and plead with her imperturbed dream in the most abject manner for clarification, no matter how meretricious, of the slow awfulness enveloping me, when we found ourselves behind the convulsed mead twosomeassorted people, you know, meeting among idyllic settings in old comedies. bill and fay were both weak with laughterwe had come at the end of their private joke. it did not really matter.         speaking as if it really did not really matter, and assuming, apparently, that life was automatically rolling on with all its routine pleasures, lolita said she would like to change into her bathing things, and spend the rest of the afternoon at the swimming pool. it was a gorgeous day. lolita                                             lo lola lolita i hear myself crying from a doorway into the sun, with the acoustics of time, domed time, endowing my call and its telltale hoarseness with such a wealth of anxiety, passion and pain that really it would have been instrumental in wrenching open the zipper of her nylon shroud had she been dead. lolita in the middle of a trim turfed terrace i found her at lastshe had run out before i was ready. oh lolita there she was playing with a damned dog, not me. the animal, a terrier of sorts, was losing and snapping up again and adjusting between his jaws a wet little red ball he took rapid chords with his front paws on the resilient turf, and then would bounce away. i had only wanted to see where she was, i could not swim with my heart in that state, but who caredand there she was, and there was i, in my robeand so i stopped calling but suddenly something in the pattern of her motions, as she dashed this way and that in her aztec red bathing briefs and bra, struck me there was an ecstasy, a madness about her frolics that was too much of a glad thing. even the dog seemed puzzled by the extravagance of her reactions. i put a gentle hand to my chest as i surveyed the situation. the turquoise blue swimming pool some distance behind the lawn was no longer behind that lawn, but within my thorax, and my organs swam in it like excrements in the blue sea water in nice. one of the bathers had left the pool and, halfconcealed by the peacocked shade of trees, stood quite still, holding the ends of the towel around his neck and following lolita with his amber eyes. there he stood, in the camouflage of sun and shade, disfigured by them and masked by his own nakedness, his damp black hair or what was left of it, glued to his round head, his little mustache a humid smear, the wool on his chest spread like a symmetrical trophy, his naval pulsating, his hirsute thighs dripping with bright droplets, his tight wet black bathing trunks bloated and bursting with vigor where his great fat bullybag was pulled up and back like a padded shield over his reversed beasthood. and as i looked at his oval nutbrown face, it dawned upon me that what i had recognized him by was the reflection of my daughters countenancethe same beatitude and grimace but made hideous by his maleness. and i also knew that the child, my child, knew he was looking, enjoyed the lechery of his look and was putting on a show of gambol and glee, the vile and beloved slut. as she made for the ball and missed it, she fell on her back, with her obscene young legs madly pedaling in the air i could sense the musk of her excitement from where i stood, and then i saw petrified with a kind of sacred disgust the man close his eyes and bare his small, horribly small and even, teeth as he leaned against a tree in which a multitude of dappled priaps shivered. immediately afterwards a marvelous transformation took place. he was no longer the satyr but a very goodnatured and foolish swiss cousin, the gustave trapp i have mentioned more than once, who used to counteract his sprees he drank beer with milk, the good swine by feats of weightliftingtottering and grunting on a lake beach with his otherwise very complete bathing suit jauntily stripped from one shoulder.          thistrapp noticed me from afar and working the towel on his name walked back with false insouciance to the pool. and as if the sun had gone out of the game, lo slackened and slowly got up ignoring the ball that the terrier placed before her. who can say what heartbreaks are caused in a dog by our discontinuing a romp i started to say something, and then sat down on the grass with a quite monstrous pain in my chest and vomited a torrent of browns and greens that i had never remembered eating.         i saw lolitas eyes, and they seemed to be more calculating than frightened. i heard her saying to a kind lady that her father was having a fit. then for a long time i lay in a lounge chair swallowing pony upon pony of gin. and next morning i felt strong enough to drive on which in later years no doctor believed.                                             the tworoom cabin we had ordered at silver spur court, elphinstone, turned out to belong to the glossily browned pinelog kind that lolita used to be so fond of in the days of our carefree first journey oh, how different things were now i am not referring to trapp or trapps. after allwell, really after all, gentlemen, it was becoming abundantly clear that all those identical detectives in prismatically changing cars were figments of my persecution mania, recurrent images based on coincidence and chance resemblance.          soyons         logiques, crowed the cocky gallic part of my brainand proceeded to rout the notion of a lolitamaddened salesman or comedy gangster, with stooges, persecuting me, and hoaxing me, and otherwise taking riotous advantage of my strange relations with the law. i remember humming my panic away. i remember evolving even an explanation of the birdsley telephone call but if i could dismiss trapp, as i had dismissed my convulsions on the lawn at champion, i could do nothing with the anguish of knowing lolita to be so tantalizingly, so miserably unattainable and beloved on the very even of a new era, when my alembics told me she should stop being a nymphet, stop torturing me.         an additional, abominable, and perfectly gratuitous worry was lovingly prepared for me in elphinstone. lo had been dull and silent during the last laptwo hundred mountainous miles uncontaminated by smokegray sleuths or zigzagging zanies. she hardly glanced at the famous, oddly shaped, splendidly flushed rock which jutted above the mountains and had been the takeoff for nirvana on the part of a temperamental show girl. the town was newly built, or rebuilt, on the flat floor of a seventhousandfoothigh valley it would soon bore lo, i hoped, and we would spin on to california, to the mexican border, to mythical bays, saguaro desserts, fatamorganas. jos lizzarrabengoa, as you remember, planned to take his carmen to the          etats unis.i conjured up a central american tennis competition in which dolores haze and various californian schoolgirl champions would dazzlingly participate. goodwill tours on that smiling level eliminate the distinction between passport and sport. why did i hope we would be happy abroad a change of environment is the traditional fallacy upon which doomed loves, and lungs, rely.         mrs. hays, the brisk, briskly rouged, blueeyed widow who ran the motor court, asked me if i were swiss perchance, because her sister had married a swiss ski instructor. i was, whereas my daughter happened to be half irish. i registered, hays gave me the key and a tinkling smile, and, still twinkling, showed me where to park the car lo crawled out and shivered a little the luminous evening air was decidedly crisp. upon entering the cabin, she sat down on a chair at a card table, buried her face in the crook of her arm and said she felt awful. shamming, i thought, shamming, no doubt, to evade my caresses i was passionately parched but she began to whimper in an unusually dreary way when i attempted to fondle her. lolita ill. lolita dying. her skin was scalding hot i took her temperature, orally, then looked up a scribbled formula i fortunately had in a jotter and after laboriously reducing the, meaningless to me, degrees fahrenheit to the intimate centigrade of my childhood, found she had ., which at least made sense. hysterical little nymphs might, i knew, run up all kinds of temperatureeven exceeding a fatal count. and i would have given her a sip of hot spiced wine, and two aspirins, and kissed the fever away, if, upon an examination of her lovely uvula, one of the gems of her body, i had not seen that it was a burning red. i undressed her. her breath was bittersweet. her brown rose tasted of blood. she was shaking from head to toe. she complained of a painful stiffness in the upper vertebraeand i thought of poliomyelitis as any american parent would. giving up all hope of intercourse, i wrapped her in a laprobe and carried her into the car. kind mrs. hays in the meantime had alerted the local doctor. you are lucky it happened here, she said for not only was blue the best man in the district, but the elphinstone hospital was as modern as modern could be, despite its limited capacity. with a heterosexual erlknig in pursuit, thither i drove, halfblinded by a royal sunset on the lowland side and guided by a little old woman, a portable witch, perhaps his daughter, whom mrs. haus had lent me, and whom i was never to see again. dr. blue, whose learning, no doubt, was infinitely inferior to his reputation, assured me it was a virus infection, and when i alluded to her comparatively recent flu, curtly said this was another bug, he had forty such cases on his hands all of which sounded like the ague of the ancients. i wondered if i should mention, with a casual chuckle, that my fifteenyearold daughter had had a minor accident while climbing an awkward fence with her boy friend, but knowing i was drunk, i decided to withhold the information till later if necessary. to an unsmiling blond bitch of a secretary i gave my daughters age as practically sixteen. while i was not looking, my child was taken away from me in vain i insisted i be allowed to spend the night on a welcome mat in a corner of their damned hospital. i ran up constructivistic flights of stairs, i tried to trace my darling so as to tell her she had better not babble, especially if she felt as lightheaded as we all did. at one point, i was rather dreadfully rude to a very young and very cheeky nurse with overdeveloped gluteal parts and blazing black eyesof basque descent, as i learned. her father was an imported shepherd, a trainer of sheep dogs. finally, i returned to the car and remained in it for i do not know how many hours, hunched up in the dark, stunned by my new solitude, looking out openmouthed now at the dimly illumined, very square and low hospital building squatting in the middle of its lawny block, now up at the wash of stars and the jagged silvery ramparts of the          haute montagnewhere at the moment marys father, lonely joseph lore was dreaming of oloron, lagore, rolas          que saisjeor seducing a ewe. suchlike fragrant vagabond thoughts have been always a solace to me in times of unusual stress, and only when, despite liberal libations, i felt fairly numbed by the endless night, did i think of driving back to the motel. the old woman had disappeared, and i was not quite sure of my way. wide gravel roads crisscrossed drowsy rectangual shadows. i made out what looked like the silhouette of gallows on what was probably a school playground and in another wastelike black there rose in domed silence the pale temple of some local sect. i found the highway at last, and then the motel, where millions of socalled millers, a kind of insect, were swarming around the neon contours of no vacancy and, when, at  a.m., after one of those untimely hot showers which like some mordant only help to fix a mans despair and weariness, i lay on her bed that smelled of chestnuts and roses, and peppermint, and the very delicate, very special french perfume i latterly allowed her to use, i found myself unable to assimilate the simple fact that for the first time in two years i was separated from my lolita. all at once it occurred to me that her illness was somehow the development of a themethat it had the same taste and tone as the series of linked impressions which had puzzled and tormented me during our journey i imagined that secret agent, or secret lover, or prankster, or hallucination, or whatever he was, prowling around the hospitaland aurora had hardly warmed her hands, as the pickers of lavender way in the country of my birth, when i found myself trying to get into that dungeon again, knocking upon its green doors, breakfastless, stoolless, in despair.         this was tuesday, and wednesday or thursday, splendidly reacting like the darling she was to some serum sparrows sperm or dugongs dung, she was much better, and the doctor said that in a couple of days she would be skipping again.         of the eight times i visited her, the last one alone remains sharply engraved on my mind. it had been a great feat to come for i felt all hollowed out by the infection that by then was at work on me too. none will know the strain it was to carry that bouquet, that load of love, those books that i had traveled sixty miles to buy brownings          dramatic works, the history of dancing, clowns and columbines, the russian ballet, flowers of the rockies, the theatre guild anthology, tennisby helen wills, who had won the national junior girl singles at the age of fifteen. as i was staggering up to the door of my daughters thirteendollara day private room, mary lore, the beastly young parttime nurse who had taken an unconcealed dislike to me, emerged with a finished breakfast tray, placed it with a quick crash on a chair in the corridor, and, fundament jigging, shot back into the roomprobably to warn her poor little dolores that the tyrannical old father was creeping up on crepe soles, with books and bouquet the latter i had composed of wild flowers and beautiful leaves gathered with my own gloved hands on a mountain pass at sunrise i hardly slept at all that fateful week.         feeding my carmencita well idly i glanced at the tray. on a yolkstained plate there was a crumpled envelope. it had contained something, since one edge was torn, but there was no address on itnothing at all, save a phony armorial design with ponderosa lodge in green letters thereupon i performed a          chasscroiswith mary, who was in the act of bustling out againwonderful how fast they move and how little they do, those rumpy young nurses. she glowered at the envelope i had put back, uncrumpled.         you better not touch, she said, nodding directionally. could burn your fingers.         below my dignity to rejoin. all i said was                   je croyais que ctait unbillnot a          billet doux. then, entering the sunny room, to lolita           bonjour, mon petit.         dolores, said mary lore, entering with me, past me, though me, the plump whore, and blinking, and starting to fold very rapidly a white flannel blanket as she blinked dolores, your pappy thinks you are getting letters from my boy friend. its me smugly tapping herself on the small glit cross she wore gets them. and my pappy can parlayvoo as well as yours.         she left the room. dolores, so rosy and russet, lips freshly painted, hair brilliantly brushed, bare arms straightened out on neat coverleat, lay innocently beaming at me or nothing. on the bed table, next to a paper napkin and a pencil, her topaz ring burned in the sun.         what gruesome funeral flowers, she said. thanks all the same. but do you mind very much cutting out the french it annoys everybody.         back at the usual rush came the ripe young hussy, reeking of urine and garlic, with the          desert news, which her fair patient eagerly accepted, ignoring the sumptuously illustrated volumes i had brought.         my sister ann, said marry topping information with afterthought, works at the ponderosa place.         poor bluebeard. those brutal brothers.          estce que tu ne maimes plus, ma carmenshe never had. at the moment i knew my love was as hopeless as everand i also knew the two girls were conspirators, plotting in basque, or zemfirian, against my hopeless love. i shall go further and say that lo was playing a double game since she was also fooling sentimental mary whom she had told, i suppose, that she wanted to dwell with her funloving young uncle and not with cruel melancholy me. and another nurse whom i never identified, and the village idiot who carted cots and coffins into the elevator, and the idiotic green love birds in a cage in the waiting roomall were in the plot, the sordid plot. i suppose mary thought comedy father professor humbertoldi was interfering with the romance between dolores and her fathersubstitute, rolypoly romeo for you          wererather lardy, you know, rom, despite all that snow and joy juice.         my throat hurt. i stood, swallowing, at the window and stared at the mountains, at the romantic rock high up in the smiling plotting sky.         my carmen, i said i used to call her that sometimes, we shall leave this raw sore town as soon as you get out of bed.         incidentally, i want all my clothes, said the gitanilla, humping up her knees and turning to another page.         because, really, i continued, there is no point in staying here.         there is no point in staying anywhere, said lolita.         i lowered myself into a cretonne chair and, opening the attractive botanical work, attempted, in the feverhumming hush of the room, to identify my flowers. this proved impossible. presently a musical bell softly sounded somewhere in the passage.         i do not think they had more than a dozen patients three or four were lunatics, as lo had cheerfully informed me earlier in that show place of a hospital, and the staff had too much leisure. howeverlikewise for reasons of showregulations were rigid. it is also true that i kept coming at the wrong hours. not without a secret flow of dreamy          malice, visionary mary next time it will be          une belle dame toute en bleufloating through roaring gulch plucked me by the sleeve to lead me out. i looked at her hand it dropped. as i was leaving, leaving voluntarily, dolores haze reminded me to bring her next morning she did not remember where the various things she wanted were bring me, she cried out of sight already, door on the move, closing, closed, the new gray suitcase and mothers trunk but by next morning i was shivering, and boozing, and dying nit he motel bed she had used for just a few minutes, and the best i could do under the circular and dilating circumstances was to send the two bags over with the widows beau, a robust and kindly trucker. i imagined lo displaying her treasures to mary no doubt, i was a little deliriousand on the following day i was still a vibration rather than a solid, for when i looked out the bathroom window at the adjacent lawn, i saw dollys beautiful young bicycle propped up there on its support, the graceful front wheel looking away from me, as it always did, and a sparrow perched on the saddlebut it was the landladys bike, and smiling a little, and shaking my poor head over my fond fancies, i tottered back to my bed, and lay as quiet as a saint                  saint, forsooth while brown dolores,         on a patch of sunny green         with sanchicha reading stories         in a movie magazine         which was represented by numerous specimens wherever dolores landed, and there was some great national celebration in town judging by the firecrackers, veritable bombs, that exploded all the time, and at five minutes to two p.m. i heard the sound of whistling lips nearing the halfopened door of my cabin, and then a thump upon it.         it was big frank. he remained framed in the opened door, one hand on its jamb, leaning forward a little.         howdy. nurse lore was on the telephone. she wanted to know was i better and would i come today         at twenty paces frank used to look a mountain of health at five, as now, he was a ruddy mosaic of scarshad been blown through a wall overseas but despite nameless injuries he was able to man a tremendous truck, fish, hunt, drink, and buoyantly dally with roadside ladies. that day, either because it was such a great holiday, or simply because he wanted to divert a sick man, he had taken off the glove he usually wore on his left hand the one pressing against the side of the door and revealed to the fascinated sufferer not only an entire lack of fourth and fifth fingers, but also a naked girl, with cinnabar nipples and indigo delta, charmingly tattooed on the back of his crippled hand, its index and middle digit making her legs while his wrist bore her flowercrowned head. oh, delicious reclining against the woodwork, like some sly fairy.         i asked him to tell mary lore i would stay in bed all day and would get into touch with my daughter sometime tomorrow if i felt probably polynesian.         he noticed the direction of my gaze and made her right hip twitch amorously.         okeydokey, big frank sang out, slapped the jamb, and whistling, carried my message away, and i went on drinking, and by morning the fever was gone, and although i was as limp as a toad, i put on the purple dressing gown over my maize yellow pajamas, and walked over to the office telephone. everything was fine. a bright voice informed me that yes, everything was fine, my daughter had checked out the day before, around two, her uncle, mr. gustave, had called for her with a cocker spaniel pup and a smile for everyone, and a black caddy lack, and had paid dollys bill in cash, and told them to tell me i should not worry, and keep warm, they were at grandpas ranch as agreed.         elphinstone was, and i hope still is, a very cute little town. it was spread like a maquette, you know, with its neat greenwool trees and redroofed houses over the valley floor and i think i have alluded earlier to its model school and temple and spacious rectangular blocks, some of which were, curiously enough, just unconventional pastures with a mule or a unicorn grazing in the young july morning mist. very amusing at one gravelgroaning sharp turn i sideswiped a parked car but said to myself telesticallyand, telepathically i hoped, to its gesticulating ownerthat i would return later, address bird school, bird, new bird, the gin kept my heart alive but bemazed my brain, and after some lapses and losses common to dream sequences, i found myself in the reception room, trying to beat up the doctor, and roaring at people under chairs, and clamoring for mary who luckily for her was not there rough hands plucked at my dressing gown, ripping off a pocket, and somehow i seem to have been sitting on a bald brownheaded patient, whom i had mistaken for dr. blue, and who eventually stood up, remarking with a preposterous accent now, who is nevrotic, i askand then a gaunt unsmiling nurse presented me with seven beautiful,          beautifulbooks and the exquisitely folded tartan lap robe, and demanded a receipt and in the sudden silence i became aware of a policeman in the hallway, to whom my fellow motorist was pointing me out, and meekly i signed the very symbolic receipt, thus surrendering my lolita to all those apes. but what else could i do one simple and stark thought stood out and this was freedom for the moment is everything. one false moveand i might have been made to explain a life of crime. so i simulated a coming out of a daze. to my fellow motorist i paid what he thought was fair. to dr. blue, who by then was stroking my hand, i spoke in tears of the liquor i bolstered too freely a tricky but not necessarily diseased heart with. to the hospital in general i apologized with a flourish that almost bowled me over, adding however that i was not on particularly good terms with the rest of the humbert clan. to myself i whispered that i still had my gun, and was still a free manfree to trace the fugitive, free to destroy my brother.                                             a thousandmile stretch of silksmooth road separated kasbeam, where, to the best of my belief, the red fiend had been scheduled to appear for the first time, and fateful elphinstone which we had reached about a week before independence day. the journey had taken up most of june for we had seldom made more than a hundred and fifty miles per traveling day, spending the rest of the time, up to five days in one case, at various stopping places, all of them also prearranged, no doubt. it was that stretch, then, along which the fiends spoor should be sought and to this i devoted myself, after several unmentionable days of dashing up and down the relentlessly radiating roads in the vicinity of elphinstone.         imagine me, reader , with my shyness, my distaste for any ostentation, my inherent sense of the          comme il faut, imagine me masking the frenzy of my grief with a trembling ingratiating smile while devising some casual pretext to flip through the hotel register oh, i would say, i am almost positive that i stayed here oncelet me look up the entries for midjuneno, i see im wrong after allwhat a very quaint name for a home town, kawtagain. thanks very much. or i had a customer staying herei mislaid his addressmay i and every once in a while, especially if the operator of the place happened to be a certain type of gloomy male, personal inspection of the books was denied me.         i have a memo here between july  and november , when i returned to beardsley for a few days, i registered, if not actually stayed, at  hotels, motels and tourist homes. this figure includes a few registrations between chestnut and beardsley, one of which yielded a shadow of the fiend n. petit, larousse, ill. i had to space and time my inquiries carefully so as not to attract undue attention and there must have been at least fifty places where i merely inquired at the deskbut that was a futile quest, and i preferred building up a foundation of verisimilitude and good will by first paying for an unneeded room. my survey showed that of the  or so books inspected, at least  provided me with a clue the loitering fiend had stopped even more often than we, or elsehe was quite capable of thathe had thrown in additional registrations in order to keep me well furnished with derisive hints. only in one case had he actually stayed at the same motor court as we, a few paces from lolitas pillow. in some instances he had taken up quarters in the same or in a neighboring block not infrequently he had lain in wait at an intermediate spot between two bespoken points. how vividly i recalled lolita, just before our departure from beardsley, prone on the parlor rug, studying tour books and maps, and marking laps and stops with her lipstick         i discovered at once that he had foreseen my investigations and had planted insulting pseudonyms for my special benefit. at the very first motel office i visited, ponderosa lodge, his entry, among a dozen obviously human ones, read dr. gratiano forbeson, mirandola, ny. its italian comedy connotations could not fail to strike me, of course. the landlady deigned to inform me that the gentleman had been laid up for five days with a bad cold, that he had left his car for repairs in some garage or other and that he had checked out on the th of july. yes, a girl called ann lore had worked formerly at the lodge, but was now married to a grocer in cedar city. one moonlit night i waylaid whiteshoed mary on a solitary street an automaton, she was about to shriek, but i managed to humanize her by the simple act of falling on my knees and with pious yelps imploring her to help. she did not know a thing, she swore. who was this gratiano forbeson she seemed to waver. i whipped out a hundreddollar bill. she lifted it to the light of the moon. he is your brother, she whispered at last. i plucked the bill out of her mooncold hand, and spitting out a french curse turned and ran away. this taught me to rely on myself alone. no detective could discover the clues trapp had tuned to my mind and manner. i could not hope, of course, he would ever leave his correct name and address but i did hope he might slip on the glaze of his own subtlety, by daring, say, to introduce a richer and more personal shot of color than strictly necessary, or by revealing too much through a qualitative sum of quantitative parts which revealed too little. in one thing he succeeded he succeeded in thoroughly enmeshing me and my thrashing anguish in his demoniacal game. with infinite skill, he swayed and staggered, and regained an impossible balance, always leaving me with the sportive hopeif i may use such a term in speaking of betrayal, fury, desolation, horror and hatethat he might give himself away next time. he never didthough coming damn close to it. we all admire the spangled acrobat with classical grace meticulously walking his tight rope in the taclum light but how much rarer art there is in the sagging rope expert wearing scarecrow clothes and impersonating a grotesque drunk          ishould know.         the clues he left did not establish his identity but they reflected his personality, or at least a certain homogenous and striking personality his genre, his type of humorat its best at leatthe tone of his brain, had affinities with my own. he mimed and mocked me. his allusions were definitely highbrow. he was wellread. he knew french. he was versed in logodaedaly and logomancy. he was an amateur of sex lore. he had a feminine handwriting. he would change his name but he could not disguise, no matter how he slanted them, his very peculiar ts, ws and ls. quelquepart island was one of his favorite residences. he did not use a fountain pen which fact, as any psychoanalyst will tell you, meant that the patient was a repressed undinist. one mercifully hopes there are water nymphs in the styx.         his main trait was his passion for tantalization. goodness, what a tease the poor fellow was he challenged my scholarship. i am sufficiently proud of my knowing something to be modest about my not knowing all and i daresay i missed some elements in that cryprogrammic paper chase. what a shiver of triumph and loathing shook my frail frame when, among the plain innocent names in the hotel recorder, his fiendish conundrum would ejaculate in my face i noticed that whenever he felt his enigmas were becoming too recondite, even for such a solver as i, he would lure me back with an easy one. arsne lupin was obvious to a frenchman who remembered the detective stories of his youth and one hardly had to be a coleridgian to appreciate the trite poke of a. person, porlock, england. in horrible taste but basically suggestive of a cultured mannot a policeman, not a common good, not a lewd salesmanwere such assumed names as arthur rainbowplainly the travestied author of          le bateau bleulet me laugh a little too, gentlemenand morris schmetterling, of          loiseau ivrefame           touch, reader. the silly but funny d. orgon, elmira, ny, was from molire, of course, and because i had quite recently tried to interest lolita in a famous thcentury play, i welcomed as an old friend harry bumper, sheridan, wyo. an ordinary encyclopedia informed me who the peculiar looking phineas quimby, lebanon, nh was and any good freudian, with a german name and some interest in religious prostitution, should recognize at a glance the implication of dr. kitzler, eryx, miss. so far so good. that sort of fun was shoddy but on the whole impersonal and thus innocuous. among entries that arrested my attention as undoubtable clues          per sebut baffled me in respect to their finer points i do not care to mention many since i feel i am groping in a borderland mist with verbal phantoms turning, perhaps, into living vacationists. who was johnny randall, ramble, ohio or was he a real person who just happened to write a hand similar to n.s. aristoff, catagela, ny what was the sting in catagela and what about james mavor morell, hoaxton, england aristophanes, hoaxfine, but what was i missing         there was one strain running through all that pseudonymity which caused me especially painful palpitations when i came across it. such things as g. trapp, geneva, ny. was the sign of treachery on lolitas part. aubrey beardsley, quelquepart island suggested more lucidly than the garbled telephone message had that the starting point of the affair should be looked for in the east. lucas picador, merrymay, pa. insinuated that my carmen had betrayed my pathetic endearments to the impostor. horribly cruel, forsooth, was will brown, dolores, colo. the gruesome harold haze, tombstone, arizona which at another time would have appealed to my sense of humor implied a familiarity with the girls past that in nightmare fashion suggested for a moment that my quarry was an old friend of the family, maybe an old flame of charlottes, maybe a redresser of wrongs donald quix, sierra, nev.. but the most penetrating bodkin was the anagramtailed entry in the register of chestnut lodge ted hunter, cane, nh.         the garbled license numbers left by all these persons and orgons and morells and trapps only told me that motel keepers omit to check if guests cars are accurately listed. referenesincompletely or incorrectly indicatedto the cars the fiend had hired for short laps between wace and elphinstone were of course useless the license of the initial aztec was a shimmer of shifting numerals, some transposed, others altered or omitted, but somehow forming interrelated combinations such as ws  and sh , and q or cu which however were so cunningly contrived as to never reveal a common denominator.         it occurred to me that after he had turned that convertible over to accomplices at wace and switched to the stagemotor car system, his successors might have been less careful and might have inscribed at some hotel office the archtype of those interrelated figures. but if looking for the fiend along a road i knew he had taken was such a complicated vague and unprofitable business, what could i expect from any attempt to trace unknown motorists traveling along unknown routes                                             by the time i reached beardsley, in the course of the harrowing recapitulation i have now discussed at sufficient length, a complete image had formed in my mind and through thealways riskyprocess of elimination i had reduced this image to the only concrete source that morbid cerebration and torpid memory could give it.         except for the rev. rigor mortis as the girls called him, and an old gentleman who taught nonobligatory german and latin, there were no regular male teachers t beardsley school. but on two occasions an art instructor on the beardsley college faculty had come over to show the schoolgirls magic lantern pictures of french castles and nineteenthcentury paintings. i had wanted to attend those projections and talks, but dolly, as was her wont, had asked me not to, period. i also remembered that gaston had referred to that particular lecturer as a brilliant          garon but that was all memory refused to supply me with the name of the chateaulover.         on the day fixed for the execution, i walked though the sleet across the campus to the information desk in maker hall, beardsley college. there i learned that the fellows name was riggs rather like that of the minister, that he was a bachelor, and that in ten minutes he would issue from the museum where he was having a class. in the passage leading to the auditorium i sat on a marble bench of sorts donated by cecilia dalrymple ramble. as i waited there, in the prostatic discomfort, drunk, sleepstarved, with my gun in my fist in my raincoat pocket, it suddenly occurred to me that i was demented and was about to do something stupid. there was not one chance in a million that albert riggs, ass. prof., was hiding my lolita at his beardsley home,  pritchard road. he could not be the villain. it was absolutely preposterous. i was losing my time and my wits. he and she were in california and not here at all.         presently, i noticed a vague commotion behind some white statues a doornot the one i had been staring atopened briskly, and amid a bevy of women students a baldish head and two bright brown eyes bobbed, advanced.         he was a total stranger to me but insisted we had met at a lawn party at beardsley school. how was my delightful tennisplaying daughter he had another class. he would be seeing me.         another attempt at identification was less speedily resolved through an advertisement in one of los magazines i dared to get in touch with a private detective, an expugilist, and merely to give him some idea of the          methodadopted by the fiend, i acquainted him with the kind of names and addresses i had collected. he demanded a goodish deposit and for two yearstwo years, readerthat imbecile busied himself with checking those nonsense data. i had long severed all monetary relations with him when he turned up one day with the triumphant information that an eightyyearold indian by the name of bill brown lived near dolores, colo.                                             this book is about lolita and now that i have reached the part which had i not been forestalled by another internal combustion martyr might be called           dolors disparue, there would be little sense in analyzing the three empty years that followed. while a few pertinent points have to be marked, the general impression i desire to convey is of a side door crashing open in lifes full flight, and a rush of roaring black time drowning with its whipping wind the cry of lone disaster.         singularly enough, i seldom if ever dreamed of lolita as i remembered heras i saw her constantly and obsessively in my conscious mind during my daymares and insomnias. more precisely she did haunt my sleep but she appeared there in strange and ludicrous disguises as valeria or charlotte, or a cross between them. that complex ghost would come to me, shedding shift after shift, in an atmosphere of great melancholy and disgust, and would recline in dull invitation on some narrow board or hard settee, with flesh ajar like the rubber valve of a soccer balls bladder. i would bind myself, dentures fractured or hopelessly mislaid, in horrible          chambres garnieswhere i would be entertained at tedious vivisecting parties that generally ended with charlotte or valeria weeping in my bleeding arms and being tenderly kissed by my brotherly lips in a dream disorder of auctioneered viennese bricbrac, pity, impotence and the brown wigs of tragic old women who had just been gassed.         one day i removed from the car and destroyed an accumulation of teenmagazines. you know the sort. stone age at heart up to date, or at least mycenaean, as to hygiene. a handsome, very ripe actress with huge lashes and a pulpy red underlip, endorsing a shampoo. ads and fads. young scholars dote on plenty of pleats          que ctait loin, tout celait is

that repulsive strip with the big gagoon and his wife, a kiddoid gnomide.          et         moi qui toffrais mon genie i recalled the rather charming nonsense verse i used to write her when she was a child nonsense, she used to say mockingly, is correct.         the squirl and his squirrel, the rabs and their rabbits         have certain obscure and peculiar habits.         male hummingbirds make the most exquisite rockets.         the snake when he walks holds his hands in his pockets         other things of hers were harder to relinquish. up to the end of , i cherished and adored, and stained with my kisses and merman tears, a pair of old sneakers, a boys shirt she had worn, some ancient blue jeans i found in the trunk compartment, a crumpled school cap, suchlike wanton treasures. then, when i understood my mind was cracking, i collected those sundry belongings, added to them what had been stored in beardsleya box of books, her bicycle, old coats, galoshesand on her fifteenth birthday mailed everything as an anonymous gift to a home for orphaned girls on a windy lake, on the canadian border.         it is just possible that had i gone to a strong hypnotist he might have extracted from me and arrayed in a logical pattern certain chance memories that i have threaded through my book with considerably more ostentation than they present themselves with to my mind even now when i know what to seek in the past. at the time i felt i was merely losing contact with reality and after spending the rest of the winter and most of the following spring in a quebec sanatorium where i had stayed before, i resolved first to settle some affairs of mine in new york and then to proceed to california for a thorough search there.         here is something i composed in my retreat                    wanted, wanted dolores haze.           hair brown. lips scarlet.           age five thousand three hundred days.           profession none, or starlet.           where are you

dolores haze           what make is the magic carpet           is a cream cougar the present craze           and where are you parked, my car pet           who is your hero, dolores haze           still one of those bluecaped starmen           oh the balmy days and the palmy bays,           and the cars, and the bars, my carmen           oh dolores, that jukebox hurts           are you still

hate and remorse, im dying.           and again my hairy fist i raise,           and again i hear you crying.           officer, officer, there they go           in the rain, where that lighted store is           and her socks are white, and i love her so,           and her name is haze, dolores.           officer, officer, there they are           dolores haze and her lover           whip out your gun and follow that car.           now tumble out, and take cover.           wanted, wanted dolores haze.           her dreamgray gaze never flinches.           ninety pounds is all she weighs           with a height of sixty inches.           my car is limping, dolores haze,           and the last long lap is the hardest,           and i shall be dumped where the weed decays,           and the rest is rust and stardust.                  by psychoanalyzing this poem, i notice it is really a maniacs masterpiece. the stark, stiff, lurid rhymes correspond very exactly to certain perspectiveless and terrible landscapes and figures, and magnified parts of landscapes and figures, as drawn by psychopaths in tests devised by their astute trainers. i wrote many more poems. i immersed myself in the poetry of others. but not for a second did i forget the load of revenge.         i would be a knave to say, and the reader a fool to believe, that the shock of losing lolita cured me of pederosis. my accursed nature could not change, no matter how my love for her did. on playgrounds and beaches, my sullen and stealthy eye, against my will, still sought out the flash of a nymphets limbs, the sly tokens of lolitas handmaids and rosegirls. but one essential vision in me had withered never did i dwell now on possibilities of bliss with a little maiden, specific or synthetic, in some outoftheway place never did my fancy sink its fangs into lolitas sisters, far far away, in the coves of evoked islands.          thatwas all over, for the time being at least. on the other hand, alas, two years of monstrous indulgence had left me with certain habits of lust i feared lest the void i lived in might drive me to plunge into the freedom of sudden insanity when confronted with a chance temptation in some lane between school and supper. solitude was corrupting me. i needed company and care. my heart was a hysterical unreliable organ. this is how rita enters the picture.                                             she was twice lolitas age and three quarters of mine a very slight, darkhaired, paleskinned adult, weighing a hundred and five pounds, with charmingly asymmetrical eyes, and angular, rapidly sketched profile, and a most appealing          ensellureto her supple backi think she had some spanish or babylonian blood. i picked her up one depraved may evening somewhere between montreal and new york, or more narrowly, between toylestown and blake, at a drakishly burning bar under the sign of the tigermoth, where she was amiably drunk she insisted we had gone to school together, and she placed her trembling little hand on my ape paw. my senses were very slightly stirred but i decided to give her a try i didand adopted her as a constant companion. she was so kind, was rita, such a good sport, that i daresay she would have given herself to any pathetic creature or fallacy, an old broken tree or a bereaved porcupine, out of sheer chumminess and compassion.         when i first met her she had but recently divorced her third husbandand a little more recently had been abandoned by her seventh          cavalier servantthe others, the mutables, were too numerous and mobile to tabulate. her brother wasand no doubt still isa prominent, pastyfaced, suspendersandpaintedtiewearing politician, mayor and booster of his ballplaying, biblereading, grainhandling home town. for the last eight years he had been paying his great little sister several hundred dollars per month under the stringent condition that she would never never enter great little grainball city. she told me, with wails of wonder, that for some goddamn reason every new boy friend of hers would first of all take her grainballward it was a fatal attraction and before she knew what was what, she would find herself sucked into the lunar orbit of the town, and would be following the floodlit drive that encircled itgoing round and round, as she phrased it, like a goddamn mulberry moth.         she had a natty little coup and in it we traveled to california so as to give my venerable vehicle a rest. her natural speed was ninety. dear rita we cruised together for two dim years, from summer  to summer , and she was the sweetest, simplest, gentles, dumbest rita imaginable. in comparison to her, valechak was a schlegel, and charlotte a hegel. there is no earthly reason why i should dally with her in the margin of this sinister memoir, but let me say hi, ritawherever you are, drunk or hangoverish, rita, hi that she was the most soothing, the most comprehending companion that i ever had, and certainly saved me from the madhouse. i told her i was trying to trace a girl and plug that girls bully. rita solemnly approved of the planand in the course of some investigation she undertook on her own without really knowing a thing, around san humbertino, got entangled with a pretty awful crook herself i had the devil of a time retrieving herused and bruised but still cocky. then one day she proposed playing russian roulette with my sacred automatic i said you couldnt, it was not a revolver, and we struggled for it, until at last it went off, touching off a very thin and very comical spurt of hot water from the hole it made in the wall of the cabin room i remember her shrieks of laughter.         the oddly prepubescent curve of her back, her ricey skin, her slow languorous columbine kisses kept me from mischief. it is not the artistic aptitudes that are secondary sexual characters as some shams and shamans have said it is the other way around sex is but the ancilla of art. one rather mysterious spree that had interesting repercussions i must notice. i had abandoned the search the fiend was either in tartary or burning away in my cerebellum the flames fanned by my fancy and grief but certainly not having dolores haze play champion tennis on the pacific coast. one afternoon, on our way back east, in a hideous hotel, the kind where they hold conventions and where labeled, fat, pink men stagger around, all first names and business and boozedear rita and i awoke to find a third in our room, a blond, almost albino, young fellow with white eyelashes and large transparent ears, whom neither rita nor i recalled having ever seen in our sad lives. sweating in thick dirty underwear, and with old army boots on, he lay snoring on the double bed beyond my chaste rita. one of his front teeth was gone, amber pustules grew on his forehead. ritochka enveloped her sinuous nudity in my raincoatthe first thing at hand i slipped on a pair of candystriped drawers and we took stock of the situation. five glasses had been used, which in the way of clues, was an embarrassment of riches. the door was not properly closed. a sweater and a pair of shapeless tan pants lay on the floor. we shook their owner into miserable consciousness. he was completely amnesic. in an accent that rita recognized as pure brooklynese, he peevishly insinuated that somehow we had purloined his worthless identity. we rushed him into his clothes and left him at the nearest hospital, realizing on the way that somehow or other after forgotten gyrations, we ewer in grainball. half a year later rita wrote the doctor for news. jack humbertson as he had been tastelessly dubbed was still isolated from his personal past. oh mnemosyne, sweetest and most mischievous of muses         i would not have mentioned this incident had it not started a chain of ideas that resulted in my publishing in the          cantrip reviewan essay on mimir and memory, in which i suggested among other things that seemed original and important to that splendid reviews benevolent readers, a theory of perceptual time based on the circulation of the blood and conceptually depending to fill up this nutshell on the minds being conscious not only of matter but also of its own self, thus crating a continuous spanning of two points the storable future and the stored past. in result of this ventureand in culmination of the impression made by my previous          travauxi was called from new york, where rita and i were living in a little flat with a view of gleaming children taking shower baths far below in a fountainous arbor of central park, to cantrip college, four hundred miles away, for one year. i lodged there, in special apartments for poets and philosophers, from september  to june , while rita whom i preferred not to display vegetatedsomewhat indecorously, i am afraidin a roadside inn where i visited her twice a week. then she vanishedmore humanly than her predecessor had done a month later i found her in the local jail. she was          trs digne, had had her appendix removed, and managed to convince me that the beautiful bluish furs she had been accused of stealing from a mrs. roland maccrum had really been a spontaneous, if somewhat alcoholic, gift from roland himself. i succeeded in getting her out without appealing to her touchy brother, and soon afterwards we drove back to central park west, by way of briceland, where we had stopped for a few hours the year before.         a curious urge to relive my stay there with lolita had got hold of me. i was entering a phase of existence where i had given up all hope of tracing her kidnapper and her. i now attempted to fall back on old settings in order to save what still could be saved in the way of          souvenir, souvenir que me veuxtuautumn was ringing in the air. to a post card requesting twin beds professor hamburg got a prompt expression of regret in reply. they were full up. they had one bathless basement room with four beds which they thought i would not want. their note paper was headed                  the enchanted hunters         near churches         no dogs                    all legal beverages                           i wondered if the last statement was true. all did they have for instance sidewalk grenadine i also wondered if a hunter, enchanted or otherwise, would not need a pointer more than a pew, and with a spasm of pain i recalled a scene worthy of a great artist          petite nymphe accroupiebut that silky cocker spaniel had perhaps been a baptized one. noi felt i could not endure the throes of revisiting that lobby. there was a much better possibility of retrievable time elsewhere in soft, richcolored, autumnal briceland. leaving rita in a bar, i made for the town library. a twittering spinster was only too glad to help me disinter midaugust  from the bound          briceland gazette, and presently, in a secluded nook under a naked light, i was turning the enormous and fragile pages of a coffinblack volume almost as big as lolita.         reader          bruderwhat a foolish hamburg that hamburg was since his supersensitive system was loath to face the actual scene, he thought he could at least enjoy a secret part of itwhich reminds one of the tenth or twentieth soldier in the raping queue who throws the girls black shawl over her white face so as not to see those impossible eyes while taking his military pleasure in the sad, sacked village. what          ilusted to get was the printed picture that had chanced to absorb my trespassing image while the          gazettesphotographer was concentrating on dr. braddock and his group. passionately i hoped to find preserved the portrait of the artist as a younger brute. an innocent camera catching me on my dark way to lolitas bedwhat a magnet for mnemosyne i cannot well explain the true nature of that urge of mine. it was allied, i suppose, to that swooning curiosity which impels one to examine with a magnifying glass bleak little figuresstill life practically, and everybody about to throw upat an early morning execution, and the patients expression impossible to make out in the print. anyway, i was literally gasping for breath, and one corner of the book of doom kept stabbing me in the stomach while i scanned and skimmed

vin tristesmile to a pocketsized wizened truculently tight old man saying this waswhat was the name again, sona former schoolmate of hers. he tried to retain her, and in the slight scuffle that followed i hurt my thumb against his hard head. in the silent painted part where i walked her and aired her a little, she sobbed and said i would soon, soon leave her as everybody had, and i sang her a wistful french ballad, and strung together some fugitive rhymes to amuse her                    the place was called            enchanted hunters.query           what indian dyes, diana, did thy

cry again, and i marched her to the car, and we drove on to new york, and soon she was reasonably happy again high up in the haze on the little terrace of our flat. i notice i have somehow mixed up two events, my visit with rita to briceland on our way to carntrip, and our passing through briceland again on our way back to new york, but such suffusions of swimming colors are not to be disdained by the artist in recollection.                                             my letterbox in the entrance hall belonged to the type that allows one to glimpse something of its contents through a glassed slit. several times already, a trick of harlequin light that fell through the glass upon an alien handwriting had twisted it into a semblance of lolitas script causing me almost to collapse as i leant against an adjacent urn, almost my own. whenever that happenedwhenever her lovely, childish scrawl was horribly transformed into the dull hand of one of my few correspondentsi used to recollect, with anguished amusement, the times in my trustful, predolorian past when i would be misled by a jewelbright window opposite wherein my lurking eye, the ever alert periscope of my shameful vice, would make out from afar a halfnaked nymphet stilled in the act of combing her aliceinwonderland hair. there was in the fiery phantasm a perfection which made my wild delight also perfect, just because the vision was out of reach, with no possibility of attainment to spoil it by the awareness of an appended taboo indeed, it may well be that the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promisedthe great rosegray nevertobehad.          mes fentreshanging above blotched sunset and welling night, grinding my teeth, i would crowd all the demons of my desire against the railing of a throbbing balcony it would be ready to take off in the apricot and black humid evening did take offwhereupon the lighted image would move and even would revert to a rib, and there would be nothing in the window but an obese partly clad man reading the paper.         since i sometimes won the race between my fancy and natures reality, the deception was bearable. unbearable pain began when chance entered the fray and deprived me of the smile meant for me.           savezvous qu dix ans ma petite tait folle de voiussaid a woman i talked to at a tea in paris, and the          petitehad just married, miles away, and i could not even remember if i had ever noticed her in that garden, next to those tennis courts, a dozen years before. and now likewise, the radiant foreglimpse, the promise of reality, a promise not only to be simulated seductively but also to be nobly heldall this, chance denied mechance and a change to smaller characters on the pale beloved writers part. my fancy was both proustianized and procrusteanized for that particular morning, late in september , as i had come down to grope for my mail, the dapper and bilious janitor with whom i was on execrable terms started to complain that a man who had seen rita home recently had been sick like a dog on the front steps. in the process of listening to him and tipping him, and then listening to a revised and politer version of the incident, i had the impression that one of the two letters which that blessed mail brought was from ritas mother, a crazy little woman, whom we had once visited on cape cod and who kept writing me to my various addresses, saying how wonderfully well matched her daughter and i were, and how wonderful it would be if we married the other letter which i opened and scanned rapidly in the elevator was from john farlow.         i have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the readers mind. no matter how many times we reopen king lear, never shall we find the good king banging his tankard in high revelry, all woes forgotten, at a jolly reunion with all three daughters and their lapdogs. never will emma rally, revived by the sympathetic salts in flauberts fathers timely tear. whatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between the book covers, his fate is fixed in our minds, and, similarly, we expect our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them. thus x will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the secondrate symphonies he has accustomed us to. y will never commit murder. under no circumstances can z ever betray us. we have it all arranged in our minds, and the less often we see a particular person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him. any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical. we would prefer not to have known at all our neighbor, the retired hotdog stand operator, if it turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen.         i am saying all this in order to explain how bewildered i was by farlows hysterical letter. i knew his wife had died but i certainly expected him to remain, throughout a devout widowhood, the dull, sedate and reliable person he had always been. now he wrote that after a brief visit to the u.s. he had returned to south america and had decided that whatever affairs he had controlled at ramsdale he would hand over to jack windmuller of that town, a lawyer whom we both knew. he seemed particularly relieved to get rid of the haze complications. he had married a spanish girl. he had stopped smoking and had gained thirty pounds. she was very young and a ski champion. they were going to india for their honeymonsoon. since he was building a family as he put it, he would have no time henceforth for my affairs which he termed very strange and very aggravating. busybodiesa whole committee of them, it appearedhad informed him that the whereabouts of little dolly haze were unknown, and that i was living with a notorious divorcee in california. his fatherinlaw was a count, and exceedingly wealthy. the people who had been renting the haze house for some years now wished to buy it. he suggested that i better produce dolly quick. he had broken his leg. he enclosed a snapshot of himself and a brunette in white wool beaming at each other among the snows of chile.         i remember letting myself into my flat and starting to say well, at least we shall now track them downwhen the other letter began talking to me in a small matteroffact voice                             dear dad           hows everything im married. im going to have a baby. i guess hes going to be a big one. i guess hell come right for christmas. this is a hard letter to write. im going nuts because we dont have enough to pay our debts and get out of here. dick is promised a big job in alaska in his very specialized corner of the mechanical field, thats all i know about it but its really grand. pardon me for withholding our home address but you may still be mad at me, and dick must not know. this town is something. you cant see the morons for the smog. please do send us a check, dad. we could manage with three or four hundred or even less, anything is welcome, you might sell my old things, because once we go there the dough will just start rolling in. writ, please. i have gone through much sadness and hardship.           yours expecting,           dolly mrs. richard f. schiller                                                      i was again on the road, again at the wheel of the old blue sedan, again alone. rita had still been dead to the world when i read that letter and fought the mountains of agony it raised within me. i had glanced at her as she smiled in her sleep and had kissed her on her moist brow, and had left her forever, with a note of tender adieu which i taped to her navelotherwise she might not have found it.         alone did i say          pas tout fait.i had my little black chum with me, and as soon as i reached a secluded spot, i rehearsed mr. richard f. schillers violent death. i had found a very old and very dirty gray sweater of mine in the back of the car, and this i hung up on a branch, in a speechless glade, which i had reached by a wood road from the now remote highway. the carrying out of the sentence was a little marred by what seemed to me a certain stiffness in the play of the trigger, and i wondered if i should get some oil for the mysterious thing but decided i had no time to spare. back into the car went the old dead sweater, now with additional perforations, and having reloaded warm chum, i continued my journey.         the letter was dated september ,  this was september , and the address she gave was general delivery, coalmont not va., not pa., not tenn.and not coalmont, anywayi have camouflaged everything, my love. inquiries showed this to be a small industrial community some eight hundred miles from new york city. at first i planned to drive all day and all night, but then thought better of it and rested for a couple of hours around dawn in a motor court room, a few miles before reaching the town. i had made up my mind that the fiend, this schiller, had been a car salesman who had perhaps got to know my lolita by giving her a ride in beardsleythe day her bike blew a tire on the way to miss emperorand that he had got into some trouble since then. the corpse of the executed sweater, no matter how i changed its contours as it lay on the back seat of the car, had kept revealing various outlines pertaining to trappschillerthe grossness and obscene bonhomie of his body, and to counteract this taste of coarse corruption i resolved to make myself especially handsome and smart as i pressed home the nipple of my alarm clock before it exploded at the set hour of six a.m. then, with the stern and romantic care of a gentleman about to fight a duel, i checked the arrangement of my papers, bathed and perfumed my delicate body, shaved my face and chest, selected a silk shirt and clean drawers, pulled on transparent taupe socks, and congratulated myself for having with me in my trunk some very exquisite clothesa waistcoat with nacreous buttons, for instance, a pale cashmere tie and so on.         i was not able, alas, to hold my breakfast, but dismissed that physicality as a trivial contretemps, wiped my mouth with a gossamer handkerchief produced from my sleeve, and, with a blue block of ice for heart, a pill on my tongue and solid death in my hip pocket, i stepped neatly into a telephone booth in coalmont ahahah, said its little door and rang up the only schillerpaul, furnitureto be found in the battered book. hoarse paul told me he did know a richard, the son of a cousin of his, and his address was, let me see,  killer street i am not going very far for my pseudonyms. ahahah, said the little door.         at  killer street, a tenement house, i interviewed a number of dejected old people and two longhaired strawberryblond incredibly grubby nymphets rather abstractly, just for the heck of it, the ancient beast in me was casting about for some lightly clad child i might hold against me for a minute, after the killing was over and nothing mattered any more, and everything was allowed. yes, dick skiller had lived there, but had moved when he married. nobody knew his address. they might know at the store, said a bass voice from an open manhole near which i happened to be standing with the two thinarmed, barefoot little girls and their dim grandmothers. i entered the wrong store and a wary old negro shook his head even before i could ask anything. i crossed over to a bleak grocery and there, summoned by a customer at my request, a womans voice from some wooden abyss in the floor, the manholes counterpart, cried out hunter road, last house.         hunter road was miles away, in an even more dismal district, all dump and ditch, and wormy vegetable garden, and shack, and gray drizzle, and red mud, and several smoking stacks in the distance. i stopped at the last housea clapboard shack, with two or three similar ones farther away from the road and a waste of withered weeds all around. sounds of hammering came from behind the house, and for several minutes i sat quite still in my old car, old and frail, at the end of my journey, at my gray goal,          finis, my friends,          finis,my friends. the time was around two. my pulse was  one minute and  the next. the drizzle crepitated against the hood of the car. my gun had migrated to my right trouser pocket. a nondescript cur came out from behind the house, stopped in surprise, and started goodnaturedly woofwoofing at me, his eyes slit, his shaggy belly all muddy, and then walked about a little and woofed once more.                                             i got out of the car and slammed its door. how matteroffact, how square that slam sounded in the void of the sunless day          woof, commented the dog perfunctorily. i pressed the bell button, it vibrated through my whole system.          personne.         je resonne.         repersonne.from what depth this renonsense woof, said the dog. a rush and a shuffle, and wooshwoof went the door.         couple of inches taller. pinkrimmed glasses. new, heapedup hairdo, new ears. how simple the moment, the death i had kept conjuring up for three years was as simple as a bit of dry wood. she was frankly and hugely pregnant. her head looked smaller only two seconds had passed really, but let me give them as much wooden duration as life can stand, and her palefreckled cheeks were hollowed, and her bare shins and arms had lost all their tan, so that the little hairs showed. she wore a brown, sleeveless cotton dress and sloppy felt slippers.         weeell she exhaled after a pause with all the emphasis of wonder and welcome.         husband at home i croaked, fist in pocket.         i could not kill          her,of course, as some have thought. you see, i loved her. it was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight.         come in, she said with a vehement cheerful note. against the splintery deadwood of the door, dolly schiller flattened herself as best she could even rising on tiptoe a little to let me pass, and was crucified for a moment, looking down, smiling down at the threshold, hollowcheeked with round          pommettes,her wateredmilkwhite arms outspread on the wood. i passed without touching her bulging babe. dollysmell, with a faint fried addition. my teeth chattered like an idiots. no, you stay out to the dog. she closed the door and followed me and her belly into the dollhouse parlor.         dicks down there, she said pointing with an invisible tennis racket, inviting my gaze to travel from the drab parlorbedroom where we stood, right across the kitchen, and through the back doorway where, in a rather primitive vista, a darkhaired young stranger in overalls, instantaneously reprieved, was perched with his back to me on a ladder fixing something near or upon the shack of his neighbor, a plumper fellow with only one arm, who stood looking up.         this pattern she explained from afar, apologetically men will be men should she call him in         no.         standing in the middle of the slanting room and emitting questioning hms, she made familiar javanese gestures with her wrists and hands, offering me, in a brief display of humorous courtesy, to choose between a rocker and the divan their bed after ten p.m.. i say familiar because one day she had welcomed me with the same wrist dance to her party in beardsley. we both sat down on the divan. curious although actually her looks had faded, i definitely realized, so hopelessly late in the day, how much she lookedhad always lookedlike botticellis russet venusthe same soft nose, the same blurred beauty. in my pocket my fingers gently let go and repacked a little at the tip, within the handkerchief it was nested in, my unused weapon.         thats not the fellow i want, i said.         the diffuse look of welcome left her eyes. her forehead puckered as in the old bitter days         not          who         where is he quick         look, she said, inclining her head to one side and shaking it in that position. look, you are not going to bring that up.         i certainly am, i said, and for a momentstrangely enough the only merciful, endurable one in the whole interviewwe were bristling at each other as if she were still mine.         a wise girl, she controlled herself.         dick did not know a thing of the whole mess. he thought i was her father. he thought she had run away from an upperclass home just to wash dishes in a diner. he believed anything. why should i want to make things harder than they were by raking up all that muck         but, i said, she must be sensible, she must be a sensible girl with her bare drum under that thin brown stuff, she must understand that if she expected the help i had come to give, i must have at least a clear comprehension of the situation.         come, his name         she thought i had guessed long ago. it was with a mischievous and melancholy smile such a sensational name. i would never believe it. she could hardly believe it herself.         his name, my fall nymph.         it was so unimportant, she said. she suggested i skip it. would i like a cigarette         no. his name.         she shook her head with great resolution. she guessed it was too late to raise hell and i would never believe the unbelievably unbelievable         i said i had better go, regards, nice to have seen her.         she said really it was useless, she would never tell, but on the other hand, after alldo you really want to know who it was well, it was         and softly, confidentially, arching her thin eyebrows and puckering her parched lips, she emitted, a little mockingly, somewhat fastidiously, not untenderly, in a kind of muted whistle, the name that the astute reader has guessed long ago.         waterproof. why did a flash from hourglass lake cross my consciousness i, too, had known it, without knowing it, all along. there was no shock, no surprise. quietly the fusion took place, and everything fell into order, into the pattern of branches that i have woven throughout this memoir with the express purpose of having the ripe fruit fall at the right moment yes, with the express and perverse purpose of renderingshe was talking but i sat melting in my golden peaceof rendering that golden and monstrous peace through the satisfaction of logical recognition, which my most inimical reader should experience now.         she was, as i say, talking. it now came in a relaxed flow. he was the only man she had ever been crazy about. what about dick oh, dick was a lamb, they were quite happy together, but she meant something different. and          ihad never counted, of course         she considered me as if grasping all at once the incredibleand somehow tedious, confusing and unnecessaryfact that the distant, elegant, slender, fortyyearold valetudinarian in velvet coat sitting beside her had known and adored every pore and follicle of her pubescent body. in her washedout gray eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party, like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.         i just managed to jerk my knee out of the range of a sketchy tapone of her acquired gestures.         she asked me not to be dense. the past was the past. i had been a good father, she guessedgranting me          that.proceed, dolly schiller.         well, did i know that he had known her mother that he was practically an old friend that he had visited with his uncle in ramsdaleoh, years agoand spoken at mothers club, and had tugged and pulled her, dolly, by her bare arm onto his lap in front of everybody, and kissed her face, she was ten and furious with him did i know he had seen me and her at the inn where he was writing the very play she was to rehearse in beardsley, two years later did i knowit had been horrid of her to sidetrack me into believing that clare was an old female, maybe a relative of his or a sometime lifemateand oh, what a close shave it had been when the wace          journalcarried his picture.         the          briceland gazettehad not. yes, very amusing.         yes, she said, this world was just one gag after another, if somebody wrote up her life nobody would ever believe it.         at this point, there came brisk homey sounds from the kitchen into which dick and bill had lumbered in quest of beer. through the doorway they noticed the visitor, and dick entered the parlor.         dick, this is my dad cried dolly in a resounding violent voice that struck me as a totally strange, and new, and cheerful, and old, and sad, because the young fellow, veteran of a remote war, was hard of hearing.         arctic blue eyes, black hair, ruddy cheeks, unshaven chin. we shook hands. discreet bill, who evidently took pride in working wonders with one hand, brought in the beer cans he had opened. wanted to withdraw. the exquisite courtesy of simple folks. was made to stay. a beer ad. in point of fact, i preferred it that way, and so did the schillers. i switched to the jittery rocker. avidly munching, dilly plied me with marshmallows and potato chips. the men looked at her fragile,          frileux, diminutive, oldworld, youngish but sickly, father in velvet coat and beige vest, maybe a viscount.         they were under the impression i had come to stay, and dick with a great wrinkling of brows that denoted difficult thought, suggested dolly and he might sleep in the kitchen on a spare mattress. i waved a light hand and told dolly who transmitted it by means of a special shout to dick that i had merely dropped in on my way to readsburg where i was to be entertained by some friends and admirers. it was then noticed that one of the few thumbs remaining to bill was bleeding not such a wonderworker after all. how womanish and somehow never seen that way before was the shadowy division between her pale breasts when she bent down over the mans hand she took him for repairs to the kitchen. for a few minutes, three or four little eternities which positively welled with artificial warmth, dick and i remained alone. he sat on a hard chair rubbing his forelimbs and frowning. i had an idle urge to squeeze out the blackheads on the wings of his perspiring nose with my long agate claws. he had nice sad eyes with beautiful lashes, and very white teeth. his adams apple was large and hairy. why dont they shave better, those young brawny chaps he and his dolly had had unrestrained intercourse on that couch there, at least a hundred and eighty times, probably much more and before thathow long had she known him no grudge. funnyno grudge at all, nothing except grief and nausea. he was now rubbing his nose. i was sure that when finally he would open his mouth, he would say slightly shaking his head aw, shes a swell kid, mr. haze. she sure is. and shes going to make a swell mother. he opened his mouthand took a sip of beer. this gave him countenanceand he went on sipping till he frothed at the mouth. he was a lamb. he had cupped her florentine breasts. his fingernails were black and broken, but the phalanges, the whole carpus, the strong shapely wrist were far, far finer than mine i have hurt too much too many bodies with my twisted poor hands to be proud of them. french epithets, a dorset yokels knuckles, an austrian tailors flat finger tipsthats humbert humbert.         good. if he was silent i could be silent too. indeed, i could very well do with a little rest in this subdued, frightenedtodeath rocking chair, before i drove to wherever the beasts lair wasand then pulled the pistols foreskin back, and then enjoyed the orgasm of the crushed trigger i was always a good little follower of the viennese medicine man. but presently i became sorry for poor dick whom, in some hypnotoid way, i was horribly preventing from making the only remark he could think up shes a swell kid.         and so, i said, you are going to canada         in the kitchen, dolly was laughing at something bill had said or done.         and so, i shouted, you are going to canada not canadai reshoutedi mean alaska, of course.         he nursed his glass and, nodding sagely, replied well, he cut it on a jagger, i guess. lost his right arm in italy.         lovely mauve almond trees in bloom. a blownoff surrealistic arm hanging up there in the pointillistic mauve. a flowergirl tattoo on the hand. dolly and bandaided bill reappeared. it occurred to me that her ambiguous, brown and pale beauty excited the cripple. dick, with a grin of relief stood up. he guessed bill and he would be going back to fix those wires. he guessed mr. haze and dolly had loads of things to say to each other. he guessed he would be seeing me before i left. why do those people guess so much and shave so little, and are so disdainful of hearing aids         sit down, she said, audibly striking her flanks with her palms. i relapsed into the black rocker.         so you betrayed me where did you go where is he now         she took from the mantelpiece a concave glossy snapshot. old woman in white, stout, beaming, bowlegged, very short dress old man in his shirtsleeves, drooping mustache, watch chain. her inlaws. living with dicks brothers family in juneau.         sure you dont want to smoke         she was smoking herself. first time i saw her doing it.          streng verbotenunder humbert the terrible. gracefully, in a blue mist, charlotte haze rose from her grave. i would find him through uncle ivory if she refused.         betrayed you no. she directed the dart of her cigarette, index rapidly tapping upon it, toward the hearth exactly as her mother used to do, and then, like her mother, oh my god, with her fingernail scratched and removed a fragment of cigarette paper from her underlip. no. she had not betrayed me. i was among friends. edusa had warned her that cue liked little girls, had been almost jailed once, in fact nice fact, and he knew she knew. yes elbow in palm, puff, smile, exhaled smoke, darting gesture. waxing reminiscent. he sawsmilingthrough everything and everybody, because he was not like me and her but a genius. a great guy. full of fun. had rocked with laughter when she confessed about me and her, and said he had thought so. it was quite safe, under the circumstances, to tell him         well, cuethey all called him cue         her camp five years ago. curious coincidence took her to a dude ranch about a days drive from elephant elphinstone. named oh, some silly nameduk duk ranch          youknow just plain sillybut it did not matter now, anyway, because the place had vanished and disintegrated. really, she meant, i could not imagine how utterly lush that ranch was, she meant it had everything but everything, even an indoor waterfall. did i remember the redhaired guy we we was good had once had some tennis with well, the place really belonged to reds brother, but he had turned it over to cue for the summer. when cue and she came, the others had them actually go through a coronation ceremony and thena terrific ducking, as when you cross the equator.          youknow.         her eyes rolled in synthetic resignation.         go on, please.         well. the idea was he would take her in september to hollywood and arrange a tryout for her, a bit part in the tennismatch scene of a movie picture based on a play of his          golden gutsand perhaps even have her double one of its sensational starlets on the kliegstruck tennis court. alas, it never came to that.         where is the hog now         he was not a hog. he was a great guy in many respects. but it was all drink and drugs. and, of course, he was a complete freak in sex matters, and his friends were his slaves. i just could not imagine i, humbert, could not imagine what they all did at duk duk ranch. she refused to take part because she loved him, and he threw her out.         what things         oh, weird, filthy, fancy things. i mean, he had two girls and tow boys, and three or four men, and the idea was for all of us to tangle in the nude while an old woman took movie pictures. sades justine was twelve at the start.         what things exactly         oh, things oh, ireally ishe uttered the i as a subdued cry while she listened to the source of the ache, and for lack of words spread the five fingers of her angularly upanddownmoving hand. no, she gave it up, she refused to go into particulars with that baby inside her.         that made sense.         it is of no importance now, she said pounding a gray cushing with her fist and then lying back, belly up, on the divan. crazy things, filthy things. i said no, im just not going to she used, in all insouciance really, a disgusting slang term which, in a literal french translation, would be          souffler your beastly boys, because i want only you. well, he kicked me out.         there was not much else to tell. that winter , fay and she had found jobs. for almost two years she hadoh, just drifted, oh, doing some restaurant work in small places, and then she had met dick. no, she did not know where the other was. in new york, she guessed. of course, he was so famous she would have found him at once if she had wanted. fay had tried to get back to the ranchand it just was not there any moreit had burned to the ground,          nothingremained, just a charred heap of rubbish. it was so          strange,so          strange         she closed her eyes and opened her mouth, leaning back on the cushion, one felted foot on the floor. the wooden floor slanted, a little steel ball would have rolled into the kitchen. i knew all i wanted to know. i had no intention of torturing my darling. somewhere beyond bills shack an afterwork radio had begun singing of folly and fate, and there she was with her ruined looks and her adult, ropeveined narrow hands and her gooseflesh white arms, and her shallow ears, and her unkempt armpits, there she was my lolita, hopelessly worn at seventeen, with that baby, dreaming already in her of becoming a big shot and retiring around  a.d.and i looked and looked at her, and knew as clearly as i know i am to die, that i loved her more than anything i had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else. she was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the nymphet i had rolled myself upon with such cries in the past an echo on the brink of a russet ravine, with a far wood under a white sky, and brown leaves choking the brook, and one last cricket in the crisp weeds but thank god it was not that echo alone that i worshipped. what i used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart,          mon         grand pch radieux, had dwindled to its essence sterile and selfish vice, all          thati canceled and cursed. you may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court, but until i am gagged and halfthrottled, i will shout my poor truth. i insist the world know how much i loved my lolita,          thislolita, pale and polluted, and big with anothers child, but still grayeyed, still sootylashed, still auburn and almond, still carmencita, still mine          changeons de vie, ma carmen, allons vivre quelque part o nous ne serons jamais spars ohio the wilds of massachusetts no matter, even if those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish, and her nipples swell and crack, and her lovely young velvety delicate delta be tainted and torneven then i would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face, at the mere sound of your raucous young voice, my lolita.         lolita, i said, this may be neither here nor there but i have to say it. life is very short. from here to that old car you know so well thee is a stretch of twenty, twentyfive paces. it is a very short walk. make those twentyfive steps. now. right now. come just as you are. and we shall live happily ever after.                    carmen, voulezvous venir avec moi                  you mean, she said opening her eyes and raising herself slightly, the snake that may strike, you mean you will give us us that money only if i go with you to a motel. is          thatwhat you mean         no, i said, you got it all wrong. i want you to leave your incidental dick, and this awful hole, and come to live with me, and die with me, and everything with me words to that effect.         youre crazy, she said, her features working.         think it over, lolita. there are no strings attached. except, perhapswell, no matter. a reprieve, i wanted to say but did not. anyway, if you refuse you will still get your          trousseau.         no kidding asked dolly.         i handed her an envelope with four hundred dollars in cash and a check for three thousand six hundred more.         gingerly, uncertainly, she received          mon         petit cadeau and then her forehead became a beautiful pink. you mean, she said, with agonized emphasis, you are giving us          four thousand bucksi covered my face with my hand and broke into the hottest tears i had ever shed. i felt them winding through my fingers and down my chin, and burning me, and my nose got clogged, and i could not stop, and then she touched my wrist.         ill die if you touch me, i said. you are sure you are not coming with me is there no hope of your coming tell me only this.         no, she said. no, honey, no.         she had never called me honey before.         no, she said, it is quite out of the question. i would sooner go back to cue. i mean         she groped for words. i supplied them mentally           hebroke my heart.          youmerely broke my life.         i think, she went onoopsthe envelope skidded to the floorshe picked it upi think its oh utterly          grandof you to give us all that dough. it settles everything, we can start next week. stop crying, please. you should understand. let me get you some more beer. oh, dont cry, im so sorry i cheated so much, but thats the way things are.         i wiped my face and my fingers. she smiled at the          cadeau.she exulted. she wanted to call dick. i said i would have to leave in a moment, did not want to see him at all, at all. we tried to think of some subject of conversation. for some reason, i kept seeingit trembled and silkily glowed on my damn retinaa radiant child of twelve, sitting on a threshold, pinging pebbles at an empty can. i almost saidtrying to find some casual remarki wonder sometimes what has become of the little mccoo girl, did she ever get betterbut stopped in time lest she rejoin i wonder sometimes what has become of the little haze girl finally, i reverted to money matters. that sum, i said, represented more or less the net rent from her mothers house she said had it not been sold years ago no i admit i          hadtold her this in order to sever all connections with r. a lawyer would send a full account of the financial situation later it was rosy some of the small securities her mother had owned had gone up and up. yes, i was quite sure i had to go. i had to go, and find him, and destroy him.         since i would not have survived the touch of her lips, i kept retreating in a mincing dance, at every step she and her belly made toward me.         she and the dog saw me off. i was surprised this a rhetorical figure, i was not that the sight of the old car in which she had ridden as a child and a nymphet, left her so very indifferent. all she remarked was it was getting sort of purplish about the gills. i said it was hers, i could go by bus. she said dont be silly, they would fly to jupiter and buy a car there. i said i would buy this one from her for five hundred dollars.         at this rate well be millionnaires next, she said to the ecstatic dog.                  carmencita, lui demandaisjeone last word, i said in my horrible careful english, are you quite, quite sure thatwell, not tomorrow, of course, and not after tomorrow, butwellsome day, any day, you will not come to live with me i will create a brand new god and thank him with piercing cries, if you give me that microscopic hope to that effect.         no, she said smiling, no.         it would have made all the difference, said humbert humbert.         then i pulled out my automatici mean, this is the kind of fool thing a reader might suppose i did. it never even occurred to me to do it.         good byaye she changed, my american sweet immortal dead love for she is dead and immortal if you are reading this. i mean, such is the formal agreement with the socalled authorities.         then, as i drove away, i heard her shout in a vibrant voice to her dick and the dog started to lope alongside my car like a fat dolphin, but he was too heavy and old, and very soon gave up.         and presently i was driving through the drizzle of the dying day, with the windshield wipers in full action but unable to cope with my tears.                                             leaving as i did coalmont around four in the afternoon by route xi do not remember the number, i might have made ramsdale by dawn had not a shortcut tempted me. i had to get onto highway y. my map showed quite blandly that just beyond woodbine, which i reached at nightfall, i could leave paved x and reached paved y by means of a transverse dirt road. it was only some forty miles long according to my map. otherwise i would have to follow x for another hundred miles and then use leisurely looping z to get to y and my destination. however, the shortcut in question got worse and worse, bumpier and bumpier, muddier and muddier, and when i attempted to turn back after some ten miles of purblind, tortuous and tortoiseslow progress, my old and weak melmoth got stuck in deep clay. all was dark and muggy, and hopeless. my headlights hung over a broad ditch full of water. the surrounding country, if any, was a black wilderness. i sought to extricate myself but my rear wheels only whined in slosh and anguish. cursing my plight, i took off my fancy clothes, changed into slacks, pulled on the bulletriddled sweater, and waded four miles back to a roadside farm. it started to rain on the way but i had not the strength to go back for a mackintosh. such incidents have convinced me that my heart is basically sound despite recent diagnoses. around midnight, a wrecker dragged my car out. i navigated back to highway x and traveled on. utter weariness overtook me and hour later, in an anonymous little town. i pulled up at the curb and in darkness drank deep from a friendly flask.         the rain had been canceled miles before. it was a black warm night, somewhere in appalachia. now and then cars passed me, red taillights receding, white headlights advancing, but the town was dead. nobody strolled and laughed on the sidewalks as relaxing burghers would in sweet, mellow, rotting europe. i was alone to enjoy the innocent night and my terrible thoughts. a wire receptacle on the curb was very particular about acceptable contents sweepings. paper. no garbage. sherryred letters of light marked a camera shop. a large thermometer with the name of a laxative quietly dwelt on the front of a drugstore. rubinovs jewelry company had a display of artificial diamonds reflected in a red mirror. a lighted green clock swam in the linenish depths of jiffy jeff laundry. on the other side of the street a garage said in its sleepgenuflection lubricity and corrected itself to gulflex lubrication. an airplane, also gemmed by rubinov, passed, droning, in the velvet heavens. how many small deadofnight towns i had seen this was not yet the last.         let me dally a little, he is as good as destroyed. some way further across the street, neon lights flickered twice slower than my heart the outline of a restaurant sign, a large coffeepot, kept bursting, every full second or so, into emerald life, and every time it went out, pink letters saying fine foods relayed it, but the pot could still be made out as a latent shadow teasing the eye before its next emerald resurrection. we made shadowgraphs. this furtive burg was not far from the enchanted hunters. i was weeping again, drunk on the impossible past.                                             at this solitary stop for refreshments between coalmont and ramsdale between innocent dolly schiller and jovial uncle ivor, i reviewed my case. with the utmost simplicity and clarity i now saw myself and my love. previous attempts seemed out of focus in comparison. a couple of years before, under the guidance of an intelligent frenchspeaking confessor, to whom, in a moment of metaphysical curiosity, i had turned over a protestants drab atheism for an oldfashioned popish cure, i had hoped to deduce from my sense of sin the existence of a supreme being. on those frosty mornings in rimelaced quebec, the good priest worked on me with the finest tenderness and understanding. i am infinitely obliged to him and the great institution he represented. alas, i was unable to transcend the simple human fact that whatever spiritual solace i might find, whatever lithophanic eternities might be provided for me, nothing could make my lolita forget the foul lust i had inflicted upon her. unless it can be proven to meto me as i am now, today, with my heart and by beard, and my putrefactionthat in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a north american girlchild named dolores haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless this can be proven and if it can, then life is a joke, i see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art. to quote an old poet                    the moral sense in mortals is the duty           we have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.                                                      there was the day, during our first tripour first circle of paradisewhen in order to enjoy my phantasms in peace i firmly decided to ignore what i could not help perceiving, the fact that i was to her not a boy friend, not a glamour man, not a pal, not even a person at all, but just two eyes and a foot of engorged brawnto mention only mentionable matters. there was the day when having withdrawn the functional promise i had made her on the eve whatever she had set her funny little heart ona roller rink with some special plastic floor or a movie matinee to which she wanted to go alone, i happened to glimpse from the bathroom, through a chance combination of mirror aslant and door ajar, a look on her face that look i cannot exactly describe an expression of helplessness so perfect that it seemed to grade into one of rather comfortable inanity just because this was the very limit of injustice and frustrationand every limit presupposes something beyond ithence the neutral illumination. and when you bear in mind that these were the raised eyebrows and parted lips of a child, you may better appreciate what depths of calculated carnality, what reflected despair, restrained me from falling at her dear feet and dissolving in human tears, and sacrificing my jealousy to whatever pleasure lolita might hope to derive from mixing with dirty and dangerous children in an outside world that was real to her.         and i have still other smothered memories, now unfolding themselves into limbless monsters of pain. once, in a sunsetending street of beardsley, she turned to little eva rosen i was taking both nymphets to a concert and walking behind them so close as almost to touch them with my person, she turned to eva, and so very serenely and seriously, in answer to something the other had said about its being better to die than hear milton pinski, some local schoolboy she knew, talk about music, my lolita remarked         you know, whats so dreadful about dying is that you are completely on your own and it struck me, as my automaton knees went up and down, that i simply did not know a thing about my darlings mind and that quite possibly, behind the awful juvenile clichs, there was in her a garden and a twilight, and a palace gatedim and adorable regions which happened to be lucidly and absolutely forbidden to me, in my polluted rags and miserable convulsions for i often noticed that living as we did, she and i, in a world of total evil, we would become strangely embarrassed whenever i tried to discuss something she and an older friend, she and a parent, she and a real healthy sweetheart, i and annabel, lolita and a sublime, purified, analyzed, deified harold haze, might have discussedan abstract idea, a painting, stippled hopkins or shorn baudelaire, god or shakespeare, anything of genuine kind. good will she would mail her vulnerability in trite brashness and boredom, whereas i, using for my desperately detached comments an artificial tone of voice that set my own last teeth on edge, provoked my audience to such outbursts of rudeness as made any further conversation impossible, oh my poor, bruised child.         i loved you. i was a pentapod monster, but i loved you. i was despicable and brutal, and turpid, and everything,          mais je taimais, je taimaisand there were times when i knew how you felt, and it was hell to know it, my little one. lolita girl, brave dolly schiller.         i recall certain moments, let us call them icebergs in paradise, when after having had my fill of herafter fabulous, insane exertions that left me limp and azurebarredi would gather her in my arms with, at last, a mute moan of human tenderness her skin glistening in the neon light coming from the paved court through the slits in the blind, her sootblack lashes matted, her grave gray eyes more vacant than everfor all the world a little patient still in the confusion of a drug after a major operationand the tenderness would deepen to shame and despair, and i would lull and rock my lone light lolita in my marble arms, and moan in her warm hair, and caress her at random and mutely ask her blessing, and at the peak of this human agonized selfless tenderness with my soul actually hanging around her naked body and ready to repent, all at once, ironically, horribly, lust would swell againand oh,          no, lolita would say with a sigh to heaven, and the next moment the tenderness and the azureall would be shattered.         midtwentieth century ideas concerning childparent relationship have been considerably tainted by the scholastic rigmarole and standardized symbols of the psychoanalytic racket, but i hope i am addressing myself to unbiased readers. once when aviss father had honked outside to signal papa had come to take his pet home, i felt obliged to invite him into the parlor, and he sat down for a minute, and while we conversed, avis, a heavy, unattractive, affectionate child, drew up to him and eventually perched plumply on his knee. now, i do not remember if i have mentioned that lolita always had an absolutely enchanting smile for strangers, a tender furry slitting of the eyes, a dreamy sweet radiance of all her features which did not mean a thing of course, but was so beautiful, so endearing that one found it hard to reduce such sweetness to but a magic gene automatically lighting up her face in atavistic token of some ancient rite of welcomehospitable prostitution, the coarse reader may say. well, there she stood while mr. byrd twirled his hat and talked, andyes, look how stupid of me, i have left out the main characteristic of the famous lolita smile, namely while the tender, nectared, dimpled brightness played, it was never directed at the stranger in the room but hung in its own remote flowered void, so to speak, or wandered with myopic softness over chance objectsand this is what was happening now while fat avis sidled up to her papa, lolita gently beamed at a fruit knife that she fingered on the edge of the table, whereon she leaned, many miles away from me. suddenly, as avis clung to her fathers neck and ear while, with a casual arm, the man enveloped his lumpy and large offspring, i saw lolitas smile lose all its light and become a frozen little shadow of itself, and the fruit knife slipped off the table and struck her with its silver handle a freak blow on the ankle which made her gasp, and crouch head forward, and then, jumping on one leg, her face awful with the preparatory grimace which children hold till the tears gush, she was goneto be followed at once and consoled in the kitchen by avis who had such a wonderful fat pink dad and a small chubby brother, and a brandnew baby sister, and a home, and two grinning dogs, and lolita had nothing. and i have a neat pendant to that little scenealso in a beardsley setting. lolita, who had been reading near the fire, stretched herself, and then inquired, her elbow up, with a grunt where is she buried anyway who oh, you know, my murdered mummy. and          youknow where her grave is, i said controlling myself, whereupon i named the cemeteryjust outside ramsdale, between the railway tracks and lakeview hill. moreover, i added, the tragedy of such an accident is somewhat cheapened by the epithet you saw fit to apply to it. if you really wish to triumph in your mind over the idea of death ray, said lo for hurrah, and languidly left the room, and for a long while i stared with smarting eyes into the fire. then i picked up her book. it was some trash for young people. there was a gloomy girl marion, and there was her stepmother who turned out to be, against all expectations, a young, gay, understanding redhead who explained to marion that marions dead mother had really been a heroic woman since she had deliberately dissimulated her great love for marion because she was dying, and did not want her child to miss her. i did not rush up to her room with cries. i always preferred the mental hygiene of noninterference. now, squirming and pleading with my own memory, i recall that on this and similar occasions, it was always my habit and method to ignore lolitas states of mind while comforting my own base self. when my mother, in a livid wet dress, under the tumbling mist so i vividly imagined her, had run panting ecstatically up that ridge above moulinet to be felled there by a thunderbolt, i was but an infant, and in retrospect no yearnings of the accepted kind could i ever graft upon any moment of my youth, no matter how savagely psychotherapists heckled me in my later periods of depression. but i admit that a man of my power of imagination cannot plead personal ignorance of universal emotions. i may also have relied too much on the abnormally chill relations between charlotte and her daughter. but the awful point of the whole argument is this. it had become gradually clear to my conventional lolita during our singular and bestial cohabitation that even the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest, which, in the long run, was the best i could offer the waif.                                             ramsdale revisited. i approached it from the side of the lake. the sunny noon was all eyes. as i rode by in my mudflecked car, i could distinguish scintillas of diamond water between the far pines. i turned into the cemetery and walked among the long and short stone monuments.          bonzhur, charlotte. on some of the graves there were pale, transparent little national flags slumped in the windless air under the evergreens. gee, ed, that was bad luckreferring to g. edward grammar, a thirtyfiveyearold new york office manager who had just been arrayed on a charge of murdering his thirtythreeyearold wife, dorothy. bidding for the perfect crime, ed had bludgeoned his wife and put her into a car. the case came to light when two county policemen on patrol saw mrs. grammars new big blue chrysler, an anniversary present from her husband, speeding crazily down a hill, just inside their jurisdiction god bless our good cops. the car sideswiped a pole, ran up an embankment covered with beard grass, wild strawberry and cinquefoil, and overturned. the wheels were still gently spinning in the mellow sunlight when the officers removed mrs. gs body. it appeared to be routine highway accident at first. alas, the womans battered body did not match up with only minor damage suffered by the car. i did better.         i rolled on. it was funny to see again the slender white church and the enormous elms. forgetting that in an american suburban street a lone pedestrian is more conspicuous than a lone motorist, i left the car in the avenue to walk unobtrusively past  lawn street. before the great bloodshed, i was entitled to a little relief, to a cathartic spasm of mental regurgitation. closed were the white shutters of the junk mansion, and somebody had attached a found black velvet hair ribbon to the white for sale sign which was leaning toward the sidewalk. no dog barked. no gardener telephoned. no miss opposite sat on the vined porchwhere to the lone pedestrians annoyance two ponytailed young women in identical polkadotted pinafores stopped doing whatever they were doing to stare at him she was long dead, no doubt, these might be her twin nieces from philadelphia.         should i enter my old house as in a turgenev story, a torrent of italian music came from an open windowthat of the living room what romantic soul was playing the piano where no piano had plunged and plashed on that bewitched sunday with the sun on her beloved legs all at once i noticed that from the lawn i had mown a goldenskinned, brownhaired nymphet of nine or ten, in white shorts, was looking at me with wild fascination in her large blueblack eyes. i said something pleasant to her, meaning no harm, an oldworld compliment, what nice eyes you have, but she retreated in haste and the music stopped abruptly, and a violentlooking dark man, glistening with sweat, came out and glared at me. i was on the point of identifying myself when, with a pang of dreamembarrassment, i became aware of my mudcaked dungarees, my filthy and torn sweater, my bristly chin, my bums bloodshot eyes. without saying a word, i turned and plodded back the way i had come. an asterlike anemic flower grew out of a remembered chink in the sidewalk. quietly resurrected, miss opposite was being wheeled out by her nieces, onto her porch, as if it were a stage and i the star performer. praying she would not call to me, i hurried to my car. what a steep little street. what a profound avenue. a red ticket showed between wiper and windshield i carefully tore it into two, four, eight pieces.         feeling i was losing my time, i drove energetically to the downtown hotel where i had arrived with a new bag more than five years before. i took a room, made two appointments by telephone, shaved, bathed, put on black clothes and went down for a drink in the bar. nothing had changed. the barroom was suffused with the same dim, impossible garnetred light that in europe years ago went with low haunts, but here meant a bit of atmosphere in a family hotel. i sat at the same little table where at the very start of my stay, immediately after becoming charlottes lodger, i had thought fit to celebrate the occasion by suavely sharing with her half a bottle of champagne, which had fatally conquered her poor brimming heart. as then, a moonfaced waiter was arranging with stellar care fifty sherries on a round tray for a wedding party. murphyfantasia, this time. it was eight minutes to three. as i walked though the lobby, i had to skirt a group of ladies who with          mille grceswere taking leave of each other after a luncheon party. with a harsh cry of recognition, one pounced upon me. she was a stout, short woman in pearlgray, with a long, gray, slim plume to her small hat. it was mrs. chatfield. she attacked me with a fake smile, all aglow with evil curiosity. had i done to dolly, perhaps, what frank lasalle, a fiftyyearold mechanic, had done o elevenyearold sally horner in  very soon i had that avid glee well under control she thought i was in california. how was with exquisite pleasure i informed her that my stepdaughter had just married a brilliant young mining engineer with a hushhush job in the northwest. she said she disapproved of such early marriages, she would never let her phillys, who was now eighteen         oh yes, of course, i said quietly. i remember phyllis. phyllis and camp q. yes, of course. by the way, did she ever tell you how charlie holmes debauched there his mothers little charges         mrs. chatfileds already broken smile now disintegrated completely.         for shame, she cried, for shame, mr. humbert the poor boy has just been killed in korea.         i said didnt she think           vient de,with the infinitive, expressed recent events so much more neatly than the english just, with the past but i had to be trotting off, i said.         there were only two blocks to windmullers office. he greeted me with a very slow, very enveloping, strong, searching grip. he thought i was in california. had i not lived at one time at beardsley his daughter had just entered beardsley college. and how was i have all necessary information about mrs. schiller. we had a pleasant business conference. i walked out into the hot september sunshine a contented pauper.         now that everything had been put out of the way, i could dedicate myself freely to the main object of my visit to ramsdale. in the methodical manner on which i have always prided myself, i had been keeping clare quiltys face masked in my dark dungeon, where he was waiting for me to come with barber and priest           rveillezvous, laqueue,il est temps de mourir i have no time right now to discuss the mnemonics of physiognomizationi am on my way to his uncle and walking fastbut let me jot down this i had preserved in the alcohol of a clouded memory the toad of a face. in the course of a few glimpses, i had noticed its slight resemblance to a cheery and rather repulsive wine dealer, a relative of mine in switzerland. with his dumbbells and stinking tricot, and fat hairy arms, and bald patch, and pigfaced servantconcubine, he was on the whole a harmless old rascal. too harmless, in fact, to be confused with my prey. in the state of mind i now found myself, i had lost contact with trapps image. it had become completely engulfed by the face of clare quiltyas represented, with artistic precision, by an easeled photograph of him that stood on his uncles desk.         in beardsley, at the hands of charming dr. molnar, i had undergone a rather serious dental operation, retaining only a few upper and lower front teeth. the substitutes were dependent on a system of plates with an inconspicuous wire affair running along my upper gums. the whole arrangement was a masterpiece of comfort, and my canines were in perfect health. however, to garnish my secret purpose with a plausible pretext, i told dr. quilty that, in hope of alleviating facial neuralgia, i had decided to have all my teeth removed. what would a complete set of dentures cost how long would the process take, assuming we fixed our first appointment for some time in november where was his famous nephew now would it be possible to have them all out in one dramatic session         a whitesmocked, grayhaired man, with a crew cut and the big flat cheeks of a politician, dr. quilty perched on the corner of his desk, one foot dreamily and seductively rocking as he launched on a glorious longrange plan. he would first provide me with provisional plates until the gums settled. then he would make me a permanent set. he would like to have a look at that mouth of mine. he wore perforated pied shoes. he had not visited with the rascal since , but supposed he could be found at his ancestral home, grimm road, not far from parkington. it was a noble dream. his foot rocked, his gaze was inspired. it would cost me around six hundred. he suggested he take measurements right away, and make the first set before starting operations. my mouth was to him a splendid cave full of priceless treasures, but i denied him entrance.         no, i said. on second thoughts, i shall have it all done by dr. molnar. his price is higher, but he is of course a much better dentist than you.         i do not know if any of my readers will ever have a chance to say that. it is a delicious dream feeling. clares uncle remained sitting on the desk, still looking dreamy, but his foot had stopped pushrocking the cradle of rosy anticipation. on the other hand, his nurse, a skeletonthin, faded girl, with the tragic eyes of unsuccessful blondes, rushed after me so as to be able to slam the door in my wake.         push the magazine into the butt. press home until you hear or feel the magazine catch engage. delightfully snug. capacity eight cartridges. full blued. aching to be discharged.                                             a gas station attendant in parkington explained to me very clearly how to get to grimm road. wishing to be sure quilty would be at home, i attempted to ring him up but learned that his private telephone had recently been disconnected. did that mean he was gone i started to drive to grimm road, twelve miles north of the town. by that time night had eliminated most of the landscape and as i followed the narrow winding highway, a series of short posts, ghostly white, with reflectors, borrowed my own lights to indicate this or that curve. i could make out a dark valley on one side of the road and wooded slopes on the other, and in front of me, like derelict snowflakes, moths drifted out of the blackness into my probing aura. at the twelfth mile, as foretold, a curiously hooded bridge sheathed me for a moment and, beyond it, a whitewashed rock loomed on the right, and a few car lengths further, on the same side, i turned off the highway up gravelly grimm road. for a couple of minutes all was dank, dark, dense forest. then, pavor manor, a wooden house with a turret, arose in a circular clearing. its windows glowed yellow and red its drive was cluttered with half a dozen cars. i stopped in the shelter of the trees and abolished my lights to ponder the next move quietly. he would be surrounded by his henchmen and whores. i could not help seeing the inside of that festive and ramshackle castle in terms of troubled teens, a story in one of her magazines, vague orgies, a sinister adult with penele cigar, drugs, bodyguards. at least, he was there. i would return in the torpid morning.         gently i rolled back to town, in that old faithful car of mine which was serenely, almost cheerfully working for me. my lolita there was still a threeyearold bobby pin of hers in the depths of the glove compartment. there was still that stream of pale moths siphoned out of the night by my headlights. dark barns still propped themselves up here and there by the roadside. people were still going to the movies. while searching for night lodgings, i passed a drivein. in a selenian glow, truly mystical in its contrast with the moonless and massive night, on a gigantic screen slanting away among dark drowsy fields, a thin phantom raised a gun, both he and his arm reduced to tremulous dishwater by the oblique angle of that receding world,and the next moment a row of trees shut off the gesticulation.                                             i left insomnia lodge next morning around eight and spent some time in parkington. visions of bungling the execution kept obsessing me. thinking that perhaps the cartridges in the automatic had gone stale during a week of inactivity, i removed them and inserted a fresh batch. such a thorough oil bath did i give chum that now i could not get rid of the stuff. i bandaged him up with a rag, like a maimed limb, and used another rag to wrap up a handful of spare bullets.         a thunderstorm accompanied me most of the way back to grimm road, but when i reached pavor manor, the sun was visible again, burning like a man, and the birds screamed in the drenched and steaming trees. the elaborate and decrepit house seemed to stand in a kind of daze, reflecting as it were my own state, for i could not help realizing, as my feet touched the springy and insecure ground, that i had overdone the alcoholic stimulation business.         a guardedly ironic silence answered my bell. the garage, however, was loaded with his car, a black convertible for the nonce. i tried the knocker. renobody. with a petulant snarl, i pushed the front doorand, how nice, it swung open as in a medieval fairy tale. having softly closed it behind me, i made my way across a spacious and very ugly hall peered into an adjacent drawing room noticed a number of used glasses growing out of the carpet decided that master was still asleep in the master bedroom.         so i trudged upstairs. my right hand clutched muffled chum in my pocket, my left patted the sticky banisters. of the three bedrooms i inspected, one had obviously been slept in that night. there was a library full of flowers. there was a rather bare room with ample and deep mirrors and a polar bear skin on the slippery floor. there were still other rooms. a happy though struck me. if and when master returned from his constitutional in the woods, or emerged from some secret lair, it might be wise for an unsteady gunman with a long job before him to prevent his playmate from locking himself up in a room. consequently, for at least five minutes i went aboutlucidly insane, crazily calm, an enchanted and very tight hunterturning whatever keys in whatever locks there were and pocketing more planned privacy than have modern glamourboxes, where the bathroom, the only lockable locus, has to be used for the furtive needs of planned parenthood.         speaking of bathroomsi was about to visit a third one when master came out of it, leaving a brief waterfall behind him. the corner of a passage did not quite conceal me. grayfaced, baggyeyed, fluffily disheveled in a scanty balding way, but still perfectly recognizable, he swept by me in a purple bathrobe, very like one i had. he either did not notice me, or else dismissed me as some familiar and innocuous hallucinationand, showing me his hairy calves, he proceeded, sleepwalkerwise, downstairs. i pocketed my last key and followed him into the entrance hall. he had half opened his mouth and the front door, to peer out through a sunny chink as one who thinks he has heard a halfhearted visitor ring and recede. then, still ignoring the raincoated phantasm that had stopped in midstairs, master walked into a cozy boudoir across the hall from the drawing room, through whichtaking it easy, knowing he was safei now went away from him, and in a baradorned kitchen gingerly unwrapped dirty chum, talking care not to leave any oil stains on the chromei think i got the wrong product, it was black and awfully messy. in my usual meticulous way, i transferred naked chum to a clean recess about me and made for the little boudoir. my step, as i say, was springytoo springy perhaps for success. but my heart pounded with tiger joy, and i crunched a cocktail glass underfoot.         master met me in the oriental parlor.         now who are you he asked in a high hoarse voice, his hands thrust into his dressinggown pockets, his eyes fixing a point to the northeast of my head. are you by any chance brewster         by now it was evident to everybody that he was in a fog and completely at my socalled mercy. i could enjoy myself.         thats right, i answered suavely.           je         suis         monsieur brustre.let us chat for a moment before we start.         he looked pleased. his smudgy mustache twitched. i removed my raincoat. i was wearing a black suit, a black shirt, no tie. we sat down in two easy chairs.         you know, he said, scratching loudly his fleshy and gritty gray cheek and showing his small pearly teeth in a crooked grin, you dont          looklike jack brewster. i mean, the resemblance is not particularly striking. somebody told me he had a brother with the same telephone company.         to have him trapped, after those years of repentance and rage to look at the black hairs on the back of his pudgy hands to wander with a hundred eyes over his purple silks and hirsute chest foreglimpsing the punctures, and mess, and music of pain to know that this semianimated, subhuman trickster who had sodomized my darlingoh, my darling, this was intolerable bliss         no, i am afraid i am neither of the brewsters.         he cocked his head, looking more pleased than ever.         guess again, punch.         ah, said punch, so you have not come to bother me about those longdistance calls         you do make them once in a while, dont you         excuse me         i said i had said i thought he had said he had never         people, he said, people in general, im not accusing you, brewster, but you know its absurd the way people invade this damned house without even knocking. they use the          vaterre, they use the kitchen, they use the telephone. phil calls philadelphia. pat calls patagonia. i refuse to pay. you have a funny accent, captain.         quilty, i said, do you recall a little girl called dolores haze, dolly haze dolly called dolores, colo.         sure, she may have made those calls, sure. any place. paradise, wash., hell canyon. who cares         i do, quilty. you see, i am her father.         nonsense, he said. you are not. you are some foreign literary agent. a frenchman once translated my          proud fleshas          la fiert de la chair. absurd.         she was my child, quilty.         in the state he was in he could not really be taken aback by anything, but his blustering manner was not quite convincing. a sort of wary inkling kindled his eyes into a semblance of life. they were immediately dulled again.         im very fond of children myself, he said, and fathers are among my best friends.         he turned his head away, looking for something. he beat his pockets. he attempted to rise from his seat.         down i saidapparently much louder than i intended.         you need not roar at me, he complained in his strange feminine manner. i just wanted a smoke. im dying for a smoke.         youre dying anyway.         oh, chucks, he said. you begin to bore me. what do you want are you french, mister woolywoobooare lets go to the barroomette and have a stiff         he saw the little dark weapon lying in my palm as if i were offering it to him.         say he drawled now imitating the underworld numskull of movies, thats a swell little gun youve got there. what dyou want for her         i slapped down his outstretched hand and he managed to knock over a box on a low table near him. it ejected a handful of cigarettes.         here they are, he said cheerfully. you recall kipling          une femme         est         une femme, mais un caporal est une cigarettenow we need matches.         quilty, i said. i want you to concentrate. you are going to die in a moment. the hereafter for all we know may be an eternal state of excruciating insanity. you smoked your last cigarette yesterday. concentrate. try to understand what is happening to you.         he kept taking the drome cigarette apart and munching bits of it.         i am willing to try, he said. you are either australian, or a german refugee. must you talk to me this is a gentiles house, you know. maybe, youd better run along. and do stop demonstrating that gun. ive an old sternluger in the music room.         i pointed chum at his slippered foot and crushed the trigger. it clicked. he looked at his foot, at the pistol, again at his foot. i made another awful effort, and, with a ridiculously feeble and juvenile sound, it went off. the bullet entered the thick pink rug, and i had the paralyzing impression that it had merely trickled in and might come out again.         see what i mean said quilty. you should be a little more careful. give me that thing for christs sake.         he reached for it. i pushed him back into the chair. the rich joy was waning. it was high time i destroyed him, but he must understand why he was being destroyed. his condition infected me, the weapon felt limp and clumsy in my hand.         concentrate, i said, on the thought of dolly haze whom you kidnapped         i did not he cried. youre all wet. i saved her from a beastly pervert. show me your badge instead of shooting at my foot, you ape, you. where is that badge im not responsible for the rapes of others. absurd that joy ride, i grant you, was a silly stunt but you got her back, didnt you come, lets have a drink.         i asked him whether he wanted to be executed sitting or standing.         ah, let me think, he said. it is not an easy question. incidentallyi made a mistake. which i sincerely regret. you see, i had no fun with your dolly. i am practically impotent, to tell the melancholy truth. and i gave her a splendid vacation. she met some remarkable people. do you happen to know         and with a tremendous lurch he fell all over me, sending the pistol hurtling under a chest of drawers. fortunately he was more impetuous than vigorous, and i had little difficulty in shoving him back into his chair.         he puffed a little and folded his arms on his chest.         now youve done it, he said.           vous voil dans de beaux draps, mon vieux.         his french was improving.         i looked around. perhaps, ifperhaps i couldon my hands and knees risk it                   alors, que faitonhe asked watching me closely.         i stooped. he did not moved. i stooped lower.         my dear sir, he said, stop trifling with life and death. i am a playwright. i have written tragedies, comedies, fantasies. i have made private movies out of          justineand other eighteenthcentury sexcapades. im the author of fiftytwo successful scenarios. i know all the ropes. let me handle this. there should be a poker somewhere, why dont i fetch it, and then well fish out your property.         fussily, busybodily, cunningly, he had risen again while he talked. i groped under the chest trying at the same time to keep an eye on him. all of a sudden i noticed that he had noticed that i did not seem to have noticed chum protruding from beneath the other corner of the chest. we fell to wrestling again. we rolled all over the floor, in each others arms, like two huge helpless children. he was naked and goatish under his robe, and i felt suffocated as he rolled over me. i rolled over him. we rolled over me. they rolled over him. we rolled over us.         in its published form, this book is being read, i assume, in the first years of  a.d.  plus eighty or ninety, live long, my love and elderly readers will surely recall at this point the obligatory scene in the westerns of their childhood. our tussle, however, lacked the oxstunning fisticuffs, the flying furniture. he and i were two large dummies, stuffed with dirty cotton and rags. it was a silent, soft, formless tussle on the part of two literati, one of whom was utterly disorganized by a drug while the other was handicapped by a heart condition and too much gin. when at last i had possessed myself of my precious weapon, and the scenario writer had been reinstalled in his low chair, both of us were panting as the cowman and the sheepman never do after their battle.         i decided to inspect the pistolour sweat might have spoiled somethingand regain my wind before proceeding to the main item in the program. to fill in the pause, i proposed he read his own sentencein the poetical form i had given it. the term poetical justice is one that may be most happily used in this respect. i handed him a neat typescript.         yes, he said, splendid idea. let me fetch my reading glasses he attempted to rise.         no.         just as you say. shall i read out loud         yes.         here goes. i see its in verse.

                            well, sir, this is certainly a fine poem. your best as far as im concerned.         he folded and handed it back to me.         i asked him if he had anything serious to say before dying. the automatic was again ready for use on the person. he looked at it and heaved a big sigh.         now look here, mac, he said. you are drunk and i am a sick man. let us postpone the matter. i need quiet. i have to nurse my impotence. friends are coming in the afternoon to take me to a game. this pistolpacking face is becoming a frightful nuisance. we are men of the world, in everythingsex, free verse, marksmanship. if you bear me a grudge, i am ready to make unusual amends. even an oldfashioned          rencontre, sword or pistol, in rio or elsewhereis not excluded. my memory and my eloquence are not at their best today, but really, my dear mr. humbert, you were not an ideal stepfather, and i did not force your little protg to join me. it was she made me remove her to a happier home. this house is not as modern as that ranch we shared with dear friends. but it is roomy, cool in summer and winter, and in a word comfortable, so, since i intend retiring to england or florence forever, i suggest you move in. it is yours, gratis. under the condition you stop pointing at me that he swore disgustingly gun. by the way, i do not know if you care for the bizarre, but if you do, i can offer you, also gratis, as house pet, a rather exciting little freak, a young lady with three breasts, one a dandy, this is a rare and delightful marvel of nature. now,          soyons raisonnables. you will only wound me hideously and then rot in jail while i recuperate in a tropical setting. i promise you, brewster, you will be happy here, with a magnificent cellar, and all the royalties from my next playi have not much at the bank right now but i propose to borrowyou know, as the bard said, with that cold in his head, to borrow and to borrow and to borrow. there are other advantages. we have here a most reliable and bribable charwoman, a mrs. vibrissacurious namewho comes from the village twice a week, alas not today, she has daughters, granddaughters, a thing or two i know about the chief of police makes him my slave. i am a playwright. i have been called the american maeterlinck. maeterlinckschmetterling, says i. come on all this is very humiliating, and i am not sure i am doing the right thing. never use herculanita with rum. now drop that pistol like a good fellow. i knew your dear wife slightly. you may use my wardrobe. oh, another thingyou are going to like this. i have an absolutely unique collection of erotica upstairs. just to mention one item the in folio deluxe          bagration islandby the explorer and psychoanalyst melanie weiss, a remarkable lady, a remarkable workdrop that gunwith photographs of eight hundred and something male organs she examined and measured in  on bagration, in the barda sea, very illuminating graphs, plotted with love under pleasant skiesdrop that gunand moreover i can arrange for you to attend executions, not everybody knows that the chair is painted yellow                  feu. this time i hit something hard. i hit the back of a black rocking chair, not unlike dolly schillersmy bullet hit the inside surface of its back whereupon it immediately went into a rocking act, so fast and with such zest that any one coming into the room might have been flabbergasted by the double miracle that chair rocking in a panic all by itself, and the armchair, where my purple target had just been, now void of all life content. wiggling his fingers in the air, with a rapid heave of his rump, he flashed into the music room and the next second we were tugging and gasping on both sides of the door which had a key i had overlooked. i won again, and with another abrupt movement clare the impredictable sat down before the piano and played several atrociously vigorous, fundamentally hysterical, plangent chords, his jowls quivering, his spread hands tensely plunging, and his nostrils emitting the soundtrack snorts which had been absent from our fight. still singing those impossible sonorities, he made a futile attempt to open with his foot a kind of seamans chest near the piano. my next bullet caught him somewhere in the side, and he rose from his chair higher and higher, like old, gray, mad nijinski, like old faithful, like some old nightmare of mine, to a phenomenal altitude, or so it seemed, as he rent the airstill shaking with the rich black musichead thrown back in a howl, hand pressed to his brow, and with his other hand clutching his armpit as if stung by a hornet, down he came on his heels and, again a normal robed man, scurried out into the hall.         i see myself following him through the hall, with a kind of double, triple, kangaroo jump, remaining quite straight on straight legs while bouncing up twice in his wake, and then bouncing between him and the front door in a balletlike stiff bounce, with the purpose of heading him off, since the door was not properly closed.         suddenly dignified, and somewhat morose, he started to walk up the broad stairs, and, shifting my position, but not actually following him up the steps, i fired three or four times in quick succession, wounding him at every blaze and every time i did it to him, that horrible thing to him, his face would twitch in an absurd clownish manner, as if he were exaggerating the pain he slowed down, rolled his eyes half closing them and made a feminine ah and he shivered every time a bullet hit him as if i were tickling him, and every time i got him with those slow, clumsy, blind bullets of mine, he would say under his breath, with a phony british accentall the while dreadfully twitching, shivering, smirking, but withal talking in a curiously detached and even amiable manner ah, that hurts, sir, enough ah, that hurts atrociously, my dear fellow. i pray you, desist. ahvery painful, very painful, indeed god hah this is abominable, you should really not his voice trailed off as he reached the landing, but he steadily walked on despite all the lead i had lodged in his bloated bodyand in distress, in dismay, i understood that far from killing him i was injecting spurts of energy into the poor fellow, as if the bullets had been capsules wherein a heady elixir danced.         i reloaded the thing with hands that were black and bloodyi had touched something he had anointed with his thick gore. then i rejoined him upstairs, the keys jangling in my pockets like gold.         he was trudging from room to room, bleeding majestically, trying to find an open window, shaking his head, and still trying to talk me out of murder. i took aim at his head, and he retired to the master bedroom with a burst of royal purple where his ear had been.         get out, get out of here, he said coughing and spitting and in a nightmare of wonder, i saw this bloodspattered but still buoyant person get into his bed and wrap himself up in the chaotic bedclothes. i hit him at very close range through the blankets, and then he lay back, and a big pink bubble with juvenile connotations formed on his lips, grew to the size of a toy balloon, and vanished.         i may have lost contact with reality for a second or twooh, nothing of the ijustblackedout sort that your common criminal enacts on the contrary, i want to stress the fact that i was responsible for every shed drop of his bubbleblood but a kind of momentary shift occurred as if i were in the connubial bedroom, and charlotte were sick in bed. quilty was a very sick man. i held one of his slippers instead of the pistoli was sitting on the pistol. then i made myself a little more comfortable in the chair near the bed, and consulted my wrist watch. the crystal was gone but it ticked. the whole sad business had taken more than an hour. he was quiet at last. far from feeling any relief, a burden even weightier than the one i had hoped to get rid of was with me, upon me, over me. i could not bring myself to touch him in order to make sure he was really dead. he looked it a quarter of his face gone, and two flies beside themselves with a dawning sense of unbelievable luck. my hands were hardly in better condition than his. i washed up as best i could in the adjacent bathroom. now i could leave. as i emerged on the landing, i was amazed to discover that a vivacious buzz i had just been dismissing as a mere singing in my ears was really a medley of voices and radio music coming from the downstairs drawing room.         i found there a number of people who apparently had just arrived and were cheerfully drinking quiltys liquor. there was a fat man in an easy chair and two darkhaired pale young beauties, sisters no doubt, big one and small one almost a child, demurely sat side by side on a davenport. a floridfaced fellow with sapphireblue eyes was in the act of bringing two glasses out of the barlike kitchen, where two or three women were chatting and chinking ice. i stopped in the doorway and said i have just killed clare quilty. good for you, said the florid fellow as he offered one of the drinks to the elder girl. somebody ought to have done it long ago, remarked the fat man. what does he say, tony asked a faded blonde from the bar. he says, answered the florid fellow, he has killed cue. well, said another unidentified man rising in a corner where he had been crouching to inspect some records, i guess we all should do it to him some day. anyway, said tony, hed better come down. we cant wait for him much longer if we want to go to that game. give this man a drink somebody, said the fat person. what a beer said a woman in slacks, showing it to me from afar.         only the two girls on the davenport, both wearing black, the younger fingering a bright something about her white neck, only they said nothing, but just smiled on, so young, so lewd. as the music paused for a moment, there was a sudden noise on the stairs. tony and i stepped out into the hall. quilty of all people had managed to crawl out onto the landing, and there we could see him, flapping and heaving, and then subsiding, forever this time, in a purple heap.         hurry up, cue, said tony with a laugh. i believe, hes still he returned to the drawing room, music drowned the rest of the sentence.         this, i said to myself, was the end of the ingenious play staged for me by quilty. with a heavy heart i left the house and walked though the spotted blaze of the sun to my car. two other cars were parked on both sides of it, and i had some trouble squeezing out.                                             the rest is a little flattish and faded. slowly i drove downhill, and presently found myself going at the same lazy pace in a direction opposite to parkington. i had left my raincoat in the boudoir and chum in the bathroom. no, it was not a house i would have liked to live in. i wondered idly if some surgeon of genius might not alter his own career, and perhaps the whole destiny of mankind, by reviving quilted quilty, clare obscure. not that i cared on the whole i wished to forget the whole messand when i did learn he was dead, the only satisfaction it gave me, was the relief of knowing i need not mentally accompany for months a painful and disgusting convalescence interrupted by all kinds of unmentionable operations and relapses, and perhaps an actual visit from him, with trouble on my part to rationalize him as not being a ghost. thomas had something. it is strange that the tactile sense, which is so infinitely less precious to men than sight, becomes at critical moment our main, if not only, handle to reality. i was all covered with quiltywith the feel of that tumble before the bleeding.         the road now stretched across open country, and it occurred to menot by way of protest, not as a symbol, or anything like that, but merely as a novel experiencethat since i had disregarded all laws of humanity, i might as well disregard the rules of traffic. so i crossed to the left side of the highway and checked the feeling, and the feeling was good. it was a pleasant diaphragmal melting, with elements of diffused tactility, all this enhanced by the thought that nothing could be nearer to the elimination of basic physical laws than deliberately driving on the wrong side of the road. in a way, it was a very spiritual itch. gently, dreamily, not exceeding twenty miles an hour, i drove on that queer mirror side. traffic was light. cars that now and then passed me on the side i had abandoned to them, honked at me brutally. cars coming towards me wobbled, swerved, and cried out in fear. presently i found myself approaching populated places. passing through a red light was like a sip of forbidden burgundy when i was a child. meanwhile complications were arising. i was being followed and escorted. then in front of me i saw two cars placing themselves in such a manner as to completely block my way. with a graceful movement i turned off the road, and after two or three big bounces, rode up a grassy slope, among surprised cows, and there i came to a gentle rocking stop. a kind of thoughtful hegelian synthesis linking up two dead women.         i was soon to be taken out of the car hi, melmoth, thanks a lot, old fellowand was, indeed, looking forward to surrender myself to many hands, without doing anything to cooperate, while they moved and carried me, relaxed, comfortable, surrendering myself lazily, like a patient, and deriving an eerie enjoyment from my limpness and the absolutely reliable support given me by the police and the ambulance people. and while i was waiting for them to run up to me on the high slope, i evoked a last mirage of wonder and hopelessness. one day, soon after her disappearance, an attack of abominable nausea forced me to pull up on the ghost of an old mountain road that now accompanied, now traversed a brand new highway, with its population of asters bathing in the detached warmth of a paleblue afternoon in late summer. after coughing myself inside out, i rested a while on a boulder, and then, thinking the sweet air might do me good, walked a little way toward a low stone parapet on the precipice side of the highway. small grasshoppers spurted out of the withered roadside weeds. a very light cloud was opening its arms and moving toward a slightly more substantial one belonging to another, more sluggish, heavenlogged system. as i approached the friendly abyss, i grew aware of a melodious unity of sounds rising like vapor from a small mining town that lay at my feet, in a fold of the valley. one could make out the geometry of the streets between blocks of red and gray roofs, and green puffs of trees, and a serpentine stream, and the rich, orelike glitter of the city dump, and beyond the town, roads crisscrossing the crazy quilt of dark and pale fields, and behind it all, great timbered mountains. but even brighter than those quietly rejoicing colorsfor there are colors and shades that seem to enjoy themselves in good companyboth brighter and dreamier to the ear than they were to the eye, was that vapory vibration of accumulated sounds that never ceased for a moment, as it rose to the lip of granite where i stood wiping my foul mouth. and soon i realized that all these sounds were of one nature, that no other sounds but these came from the streets of the transparent town, with the women at home and the men away. reader what i heard was but the melody of children at play, nothing but that, and so limpid was the air that within this vapor of blended voices, majestic and minute, remote and magically near, frank and divinely enigmaticone could hear now and then, as if released, an almost articulate spurt of vivid laughter, or the crack of a bat, or the clatter of a toy wagon, but it was all really too far for the eye to distinguish any movement in the lightly etched streets. i stood listening to that musical vibration from my lofty slope, to those flashes of separate cries with a kind of demure murmur for background, and then i knew that the hopelessly poignant thing was not lolitas absence from my side, but the absence of her voice from that concord.         this then is my story. i have reread it. it has bits of marrow sticking to it, and blood, and beautiful brightgreen flies. at this or that twist of it i feel my slippery self eluding me, gliding into deeper and darker waters than i care to probe. i have camouflaged what i could so as not to hurt people. and i have toyed with many pseudonyms for myself before i hit on a particularly apt one. there are in my notes otto otto and mesmer mesmer and lambert lambert, but for some reason i think my choice expresses the nastiness best.         when i started, fiftysix days ago, to write          lolita, first in the psychopathic ward for observation, and then in this wellheated, albeit tombal, seclusion, i thought i would use these notes in toto at my trial, to save not my head, of course, but my soul. in mindcomposition, however, i realized that i could not parade living lolita. i still may use parts of this memoir in hermetic sessions, but publication is to be deferred.         for reasons that may appear more obvious than they really are, i am opposed to capital punishment this attitude will be, i trust, shared by the sentencing judge. had i come before myself, i would have given humbert at least thirtyfive years for rape, and dismissed the rest of the charges. but even so, dolly schiller will probably survive me by many years. the following decision i make with all the legal impact and support of a signed testament i wish this memoir to be published only when lolita is no longer alive.         thus, neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book. but while the blood still throbs through my writing hand, you are still as much part of blessed matter as i am, and i can still talk to you from here to alaska. be true to your dick. do not let other fellows touch you. do not talk to strangers. i hope you will love your baby. i hope it will be a boy. that husband of yours, i hope, will always treat you well, because otherwise my specter shall come at him, like black smoke, like a demented giant, and pull him apart nerve by nerve. and do not pity c. q. one had to choose between him and h.h., and one wanted h.h. to exist at least a couple of months longer, so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations. i am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. and this is the only immortality you and i may share, my lolita.'"

to pass around in a minute some lovely, glossyblue picturepostcards. he owned a luxurious hotel on the riviera. his father and two grandfathers had sold wine, jewels and silk, respectively. at thirty

suddenly entered and traversed by the rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer dusk a furry warmth, golden midges.         my mothers elder sister, sybil, whom a cousin of my fathers had married and then neglected, served in my immediate family as a kind of unpaid governess and housekeeper. somebody told me later that she had been in love with my father, and that he had lightheartedly taken advantage of it one rainy day and forgotten it by the time the weather cleared. i was extremely fond of her, despite the rigiditythe fatal rigidityof some of her rules. perhaps she wanted to make of me, in the fullness of time, a better widower than my father. aunt sybil had pinkrimmed azure eyes and a waxen complexion. she wrote poetry. she was poetically superstitious. she said she knew she would die soon after my sixteenth birthday, and did. her husband, a great traveler in perfumes, spent most of his time in america, where eventually he founded a firm and acquired a bit of real estate.         i grew, a happy, healthy child in a bright would of illustrated books, clean sand, orange trees, friendly dogs, sea vistas and smiling faces. around me the splendid hotel mirana revolved as a kind of private universe, a whitewashed cosmos within the blue greater one that blazed outside. from the aproned potscrubber to the flanneled potentate, everybody liked me, everybody petted me. elderly american ladies leaning on their canes listed towards me like towers of pisa. ruined russian princesses who could not pay my father, bought me expensive bonbons. he,          mon cher petit papa, took me out boating and biking, taught me to swim and dive and waterski, read to me          don quixoteand          les miserables, and i adored and respected him and felt glad for him whenever i overheard the servants discuss his various ladyfriends, beautiful and kind beings who made much of me and cooed and shed precious tears over my cheerful motherlessness.         i attended an english day school a few miles from home, and there i played rackets and fives, and got excellent marks, and was on perfect terms with schoolmates and teachers alike. the only definite sexual events that i can remember as having occurred before my thirteenth birthday that is, before i first saw my little annabel were a solemn, decorous and purely theoretical talk about pubertal surprises in the rose garden of the school with an american kid, the son of a then celebrated motionpicture actress whom he seldom saw in the threedimensional world and some interesting reactions on the part of my organism to certain photographs, pearl and umbra, with infinitely soft partings, in pichons sumptuous          le beaute humainethat that i had filched from under a mountain of marblebound          graphicsin the hotel library. later, in his delightful debonair manner, my father gave me all the information he thought i needed about sex this was just before sending me, in the autumn of , to a          lycein lyon where we were to spend three winters but alas, in the summer of that year, he was touring italy with mme de r. and her daughter, and i had nobody to complain to, nobody to consult.                                             annabel was, like the writer, of mixed parentage halfenglish, halfdutch, in her case. i remember her features far less distinctly today than i did a few years ago, before i knew lolita. there are two kinds of visual memory one when you skillfully recreate an image in the laboratory of your mind, with your eyes open and then i see annabel in such general terms as honeycolored skin, think arms, brown bobbed hair, long lashes, big bright mouth and the other when you instantly evoke, with shut eyes, on the dark inner side of your eyelids, the objective, absolutely optical replica of a beloved face, a little ghost in natural colors and this is how i see lolita.         let me therefore primly limit myself, in describing annabel, to saying she was a lovely child a few months my junior. her parents were old friends of my aunts, and as stuffy as she. they had rented a villa not far from hotel mirana. bald brown mr. leigh and fat, powdered mrs. leigh born vanessa van ness. how i loathed them at first, annabel and i talked of peripheral affairs. she kept lifting handfuls of fine sand and letting it pour through her fingers. our brains were turned the way those of intelligent european preadolescents were in our day and set, and i doubt if much individual genius should be assigned to our interest in the plurality of inhabited worlds, competitive tennis, infinity, solipsism and so on. the softness and fragility of baby animals caused us the same intense pain. she wanted to be a nurse in some famished asiatic country i wanted to be a famous spy.         all at once we were madly, clumsily, shamelessly, agonizingly in love with each other hopelessly, i should add, because that frenzy of mutual possession might have been assuaged only by our actually imbibing and assimilating every particle of each others soul and flesh but there we were, unable even to mate as slum children would have so easily found an opportunity to do. after one wild attempt we made to meet at night in her garden of which more later, the only privacy we were allowed was to be out of earshot but not out of sight on the populous part of the          plage. there, on the soft sand, a few feet away from our elders, we would sprawl all morning, in a petrified paroxysm of desire, and take advantage of every blessed quirk in space and time to touch each other her hand, halfhidden in the sand, would creep toward me, its slender brown fingers sleepwalking nearer and nearer then, her opalescent knee would start on a long cautious journey sometimes a chance rampart built by younger children granted us sufficient concealment to graze each others salty lips these incomplete contacts drove our healthy and inexperienced young bodies to such a state of exasperation that not even the cold blue water, under which we still clawed at each other, could bring relief.         among some treasures i lost during the wanderings of my adult years, there was a snapshot taken by my aunt which showed annabel, her parents and the staid, elderly, lame gentleman, a dr. cooper, who that same summer courted my aunt, grouped around a table in a sidewalk cafe. annabel did not come out well, caught as she was in the act of bending over her          chocolat glace, and her thin bare shoulders and the parting in her hair were about all that could be identified as i remember that picture amid the sunny blur into which her lost loveliness graded but i, sitting somewhat apart from the rest, came out with a kind of dramatic conspicuousness a moody, beetlebrowed boy in a dark sport shirt and welltailored white shorts, his legs crossed, sitting in profile, looking away. that photograph was taken on the last day of our fatal summer and just a few minutes before we made our second and final attempt to thwart fate. under the flimsiest of pretexts this was our very last chance, and nothing really mattered we escaped from the cafe to the beach, and found a desolate stretch of sand, and there, in the violet shadow of some red rocks forming a kind of cave, had a brief session of avid caresses, with somebodys lost pair of sunglasses for only witness. i was on my knees, and on the point of possessing my darling, when two bearded bathers, the old man of the sea and his brother, came out of the sea with exclamations of ribald encouragement, and four months later she died of typhus in corfu.                                             i leaf again and again through these miserable memories, and keep asking myself, was it then, in the glitter of that remote summer, that the rift in my life began or was my excessive desire for that child only the first evidence of an inherent singularity when i try to analyze my own cravings, motives, actions and so forth, i surrender to a sort of retrospective imagination which feeds the analytic faculty with boundless alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork and refork without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past. i am convinced, however, that in a certain magic and fateful way lolita began with annabel.         i also know that the shock of annabels death consolidated the frustration of that nightmare summer, made of it a permanent obstacle to any further romance throughout the cold years of my youth. the spiritual and the physical had been blended in us with a perfection that must remain incomprehensible to the matteroffact, crude, standardbrained youngsters of today. long after her death i felt her thoughts floating through mine. long before we met we had had the same dreams. we compared notes. we found strange affinities. the same june of the same year  a stray canary had fluttered into her house and mine, in two widely separated countries. oh, lolita, had          youloved me thus         i have reserved for the conclusion of my annabel phase the account of our unsuccessful first tryst. one night, she managed to deceive the vicious vigilance of her family. in a nervous and slenderleaved mimosa grove at the back of their villa we found a perch on the ruins of a low stone wall. through the darkness and the tender trees we could see the arabesques of lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of sensitive memory, appear to me now like playing cardspresumably because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy. she trembled and twitched as i kissed the corner of her parted lips and the hot lobe of her ear. a cluster of stars palely glowed above us, between the silhouettes of long thin leaves that vibrant sky seemed as naked as she was under her light frock. i saw her face in the sky, strangely distinct, as if it emitted a faint radiance of its own. her legs, her lovely live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand located what it sought, a dreamy and eerie expression, halfpleasure, halfpain, came over those childish features. she sat a little higher than i, and whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to kiss me, her head would bend with a sleepy, soft, drooping movement that was almost woeful, and her bare knees caught and compressed my wrist, and slackened again and her quivering mouth, distorted by the acridity of some mysterious potion, with a sibilant intake of breath came near to my face. she would try to relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips against mine then my darling would draw away with a nervous toss of her hair, and then again come darkly near and let me feed on her open mouth, while with a generosity that was ready to offer her everything, my heart, my throat, my entrails, i have her to hold in her awkward fist the scepter of my passion.         i recall the scent of some kind of toilet powderi believe she stole it from her mothers spanish maida sweetish, lowly, musky perfume. it mingled with her own biscuity odor, and my senses were suddenly filled to the brim a sudden commotion in a nearby bush prevented them from overflowingand as we drew away from each other, and with aching veins attended to what was probably a prowling cat, there came from the house her mothers voice calling her, with a rising frantic noteand dr. cooper ponderously limped out into the garden. but that mimosa grovethe haze of stars, the tingle, the flame, the honeydew, and the ache remained with me, and that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted me ever sinceuntil at last, twentyfour years later, i broke her spell by incarnating her in another.                                             the days of my youth, as i look back on them, seem to fly away from me in a flurry of pale repetitive scraps like those morning snow storms of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the observation car. in my sanitary relations with women i was practical, ironical and brisk. while a college student, in london and paris, paid ladies sufficed me. my studies were meticulous and intense, although not particularly fruitful. at first, i planned to take a degree in psychiatry and many          manqutalents do but i was even more          manquthan that a peculiar exhaustion, i am so oppressed, doctor, set in and i switched to english literature, where so many frustrated poets end as pipesmoking teachers in tweeds. paris suited me. i discussed soviet movies with expatriates. i sat with uranists in the deux magots. i published tortuous essays in obscure journals. i composed pastiches                                 frulen von kulp             may turn, her hand upon the door             i will not follow her. nor fresca. nor             that gull.                             a paper of mine entitled the proustian theme in a letter from keats to benjamin bailey was chuckled over by the six or seven scholars who read it. i launched upon an           histoire abregee de la poesie anglaise for a prominent publishing firm, and then started to compile that manual of french literature for englishspeaking students with comparisons drawn from english writers which was to occupy me throughout the fortiesand the last volume of which was almost ready for press by the time of my arrest.         i found a jobteaching english to a group of adults in auteuil. then a school for boys employed me for a couple of winters. now and then i took advantage of the acquaintances i had formed among social workers and psychotherapists to visit in their company various institutions, such as orphanages and reform schools, where pale pubescent girls with matted eyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of that granted one in dreams.         now i wish to introduce the following idea. between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than they, reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic that is, demoniac and these chosen creatures i propose to designate as nymphets.         it will be marked that i substitute time terms for spatial ones. in fact, i would have the reader see nine and fourteen as the boundariesthe mirrory beaches and rosy rocksof an enchanted island haunted by those nymphets of mine and surrounded by a vast, misty sea. between those age limits, are all girlchildren nymphets of course not. otherwise, we who are in the know, we lone voyagers, we nympholepts, would have long gone insane. neither are good looks any criterion and vulgarity, or at least what a given community terms so, does not necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace, the elusive, shifty, soulshattering, insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where lolita plays with her likes. within the same age limits the number of true nymphets is trickingly inferior to that of provisionally plain, or just nice, or cute, or even sweet and attractive, ordinary, plumpish, formless, coldskinned, essentially human little girls, with tummies and pigtails, who may or may not turn into adults of great beauty look at the ugly dumplings in black stockings and white hats that are metamorphosed into stunning stars of the screen. a normal man given a group photograph of school girls or girl scouts and asked to point out the comeliest one will not necessarily choose the nymphet among them. you have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite melancholy, with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a supervoluptuous flame permanently aglow in your subtle spine oh, how you have to cringe and hide, in order to discern at once, by ineffable signsthe slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the slenderness of a downy limb, and other indices which despair and shame and tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulatethe little deadly demon among the wholesome children          shestands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic power.         furthermore, since the idea of time plays such a magic part in the matter, the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be a gap of several years, never less than ten i should say, generally thirty or forty, and as many as ninety in a few known cases, between maiden and man to enable the latter to come under a nymphets spell. it is a question of focal adjustment, of a certain distance that the inner eye thrills to surmount, and a certain contrast that the mind perceives with a gasp of perverse delight. when i was a child and she was a child, my little annabel was no nymphet to me i was her equal, a faunlet in my own right, on that same enchanted island of time but today, in september , after twentynine years have elapsed, i think i can distinguish in her the initial fateful elf in my life. we loved each other with a premature love, marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives. i was a strong lad and survived but the poison was in the wound, and the wound remained ever open, and soon i found myself maturing amid a civilization which allows a man of twentyfive to court a girl of sixteen but not a girl of twelve.         no wonder, then, that my adult life during the european period of my existence proved monstrously twofold. overtly, i had socalled normal relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins or pears for breasts inly, i was consumed by a hell furnace of localized lust for every passing nymphet whom as a lawabiding poltroon i never dared approach. the human females i was allowed to wield were but palliative agents. i am ready to believe that the sensations i derived from natural fornication were much the same as those known to normal big males consorting with their normal big mates in that routine rhythm which shakes the world. the trouble was that those gentlemen had not, and i          had, caught glimpses of an incomparably more poignant bliss. the dimmest of my pollutive dreams was a thousand times more dazzling than all the adultery the most virile writer of genius or the most talented impotent might imagine. my world was split. i was aware of not one but two sexes, neither of which was mine both would be termed female by the anatomist. but to me, through the prism of my senses, they were as different as mist and mast. all this i rationalize now. in my twenties and early thirties, i did not understand my throes quite so clearly. while my body knew what it craved for, my mind rejected my bodys every plea. one moment i was ashamed and frightened, another recklessly optimistic. taboos strangulated me. psychoanalysts wooed me with pseudoliberations of pseudolibidoes. the fact that to me the only object of amorous tremor were sisters of annabels, her handmaids and girlpages, appeared to me at times as a forerunner of insanity. at other times i would tell myself that it was all a question of attitude, that there was really nothing wrong in being moved to distraction by girlchildren. let me remind my reader that in england, with the passage of the children and young person act in , the term girlchild is defined as a girl who is over eight but under fourteen years after that, from fourteen to seventeen, the statutory definition is young person. in massachusetts, u.s., on the other hand, a wayward child is, technically, one between seven and seventeen years of age who, moreover, habitually associates with vicious or immoral persons. hugh broughton, a writer of controversy in the reign of james the first, has proved that rahab was a harlot at ten years of age. this is all very interesting, and i daresay you see me already frothing at the mouth in a fit but no, i am not i am just winking happy thoughts into a little tiddle cup. here are some more pictures. here is virgil who could the nymphet sing in a single tone, but probably preferred a lads perineum. here are two of king akhnatens and queen nefertitis prenubile nile daughters that royal couple had a litter of six, wearing nothing but many necklaces of bright beads, relaxed on cushions, intact after three thousand years, with their soft brown puppybodies, cropped hair and long ebony eyes. here are some brides of ten compelled to seat themselves on the fascinum, the virile ivory in the temples of classical scholarship. marriage and cohabitation before the age of puberty are still not uncommon in certain east indian provinces. lepcha old men of eighty copulate with girls of eight, and nobody minds. after all, dante fell madly in love with beatrice when she was nine, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely, and bejeweled, in a crimson frock, and this was in , in florence, at a private feast in the merry month of may. and when petrarch fell madly in love with his laureen, she was a fairhaired nymphet of twelve running in the wind, in the pollen and dust, a flower in flight, in the beautiful plain as descried from the hills of vaucluse.         but let us be prim and civilized. humbert humbert tried hard to be good. really and truly, he id. he had the utmost respect for ordinary children, with their purity and vulnerability, and under no circumstances would he have interfered with the innocence of a child, if there was the least risk of a row. but how his heart beat when, among the innocent throng, he espied a demon child,           enfant charmante et fourbe, dim eyes, bright lips, ten years in jail if you only show her you are looking at her. so life went. humbert was perfectly capable of intercourse with eve, but it was lilith he longed for. the budstage of breast development appears early . years in the sequence of somatic changes accompanying pubescence. and the next maturational item available is the first appearance of pigmented pubic hair . years. my little cup brims with tiddles.         a shipwreck. an atoll. alone with a drowned passengers shivering child. darling, this is only a game how marvelous were my fancied adventures as i sat on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a trembling book. around the quiet scholar, nymphets played freely, as if he were a familiar statue or part of an old trees shadow and sheen. once a perfect little beauty in a tartan frock, with a clatter put her heavily armed foot near me upon the bench to dip her slim bare arms into me and righten the strap of her roller skate, and i dissolved in the sun, with my book for fig leaf, as her auburn ringlets fell all over her skinned knee, and the shadow of leaves i shared pulsated and melted on her radiant limb next to my chameloenic cheek. another time a redhaired school girl hung over me in the          metro, and a revelation of axillary russet i obtained remained in my blood for weeks. i could list a great number of these onesided diminutive romances. some of them ended in a rich flavor of hell. it happened for instance that from my balcony i would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like a nymphet in the act of undressing before a cooperative mirror. thus isolated, thus removed, the vision acquired an especially keen charm that made me race with all speed toward my lone gratification. but abruptly, fiendishly, the tender pattern of nudity i had adored would be transformed into the disgusting lamplit bare arm of a man in his underclothes reading his paper by the open window in the hot, damp, hopeless summer night.         ropeskipping, hopscotch. that old woman in black who sat down next to me on my bench, on my rack of joy a nymphet was groping under me for a lost marble, and asked if i had stomachache, the insolent hag. ah, leave me alone in my pubescent park, in my mossy garden. let them play around me forever. never grow up.                                             a propos i have often wondered what became of those nymphets later in this wroughtiron would of crisscross cause and effect, could it be that the hidden throb i stole from them did not affect          theirfuture i had possessed herand she never knew it. all right. but would it not tell sometime later had i not somehow tampered with her fate by involving her image in my voluptas oh, it was, and remains, a source of great and terrible wonder.         i learned, however, what they looked like, those lovely, maddening, thinarmed nymphets, when they grew up. i remember walking along an animated street on a gray spring afternoon somewhere near the madeleine. a short slim girl passed me at a rapid, highheeled, tripping step, we glanced back at the same moment, she stopped and i accosted her. she came hardly up to my chest hair and had the kind of dimpled round little face french girls so often have, and i liked her long lashes and tightfitting tailored dress sheathing in pearlgray her young body which still retainedand that was the nymphic echo, the chill of delight, the leap in my loinsa childish something mingling with the professional          fretillementof her small agile rump. i asked her price, and she promptly replied with melodious silvery precision a bird, a very bird           cent. i tried to haggle but she saw the awful lone longing in my lowered eyes, directed so far down at her round forehead and rudimentary hat a band, a posy and with one beat of her lashes           tant pis, she said, and made as if to move away. perhaps only three years earlier i might have seen her coming home from school that evocation settled the matter. she led me up the usual steep stairs, with the usual bell clearing the way for the          monsieurwho might not care to meet another          monsieur, on the mournful climb to the abject room, all bed and          bidet. as usual, she asked at once for her petit          cadeau, and as usual i asked her name monique and her age eighteen. i was pretty well acquainted with the banal way of streetwalkers. they all answer           dixhuita trim twitter, a note of finality and wistful deceit which they emit up to ten times per day, the poor little creatures. but in moniques case there could be no doubt she was, if anything, adding one or two years to her age. this i deduced from many details of her compact, neat, curiously immature body. having shed her clothes with fascinating rapidity, she stood for a moment partly wrapped in the dingy gauze of the window curtain listening with infantile pleasure, as pat as pat could be, to an organgrinder in the dustbrimming courtyard below. when i examined her small hands and drew her attention to their grubby fingernails, she said with a naive frown           oui, ce nest pas bien, and went to the washbasin, but i said it did not matter, did not matter at all. with her brown bobbed hair, luminous gray eyes and pale skin, she looked perfectly charming. her hips were no bigger than those of a squatting lad in fact, i do not hesitate to say and indeed this is the reason why i linger gratefully in that gauzegray room of memory with little monique that among the eighty or so          gruesi had had operate upon me, she was the only one that gave me a pang of genuine pleasure.           il etait malin, celui qui         a         invente ce trucla, she commented amiably, and got back into her clothes with the same highstyle speed.         i asked for another, more elaborate, assignment later the same evening, and she said she would meet me at the corner cafe at nine, and swore she had never          pose         un         lapinin all her young life. we returned to the same room, and i could not help saying how very pretty she was to which she answered demurely           tu es bien gentil de dire ca and then, noticing what i noticed too in the mirror reflecting our small edenthe dreadful grimace of clenchedteeth tenderness that distorted my mouthdutiful little monique oh, she had been a nymphet, all right wanted to know if she should remove the layer of red from her lips          avant quon se couchein case i planned to kiss her. of course, i planned it. i let myself go with her more completely than i had with any young lady before, and my last vision that night of longlashed monique is touched up with a gaiety that i find seldom associated with any event in my humiliating, sordid, taciturn love life. she looked tremendously pleased with the bonus of fifty i gave her as she trotted out into the april night drizzle with humbert humbert lumbering in her narrow wake. stopping before a window display she said with great gusto           je vais macheter des bas and never may i forget the way her parisian childish lips exploded on           bas, pronouncing it with an appetite that all but changed the a into a brief buoyant bursting o as in           bot.         i had a date with her next day at . p.m. in my own rooms, but it was less successful, she seemed to have grown less juvenile, more of a woman overnight. a cold i caught from her led me to cancel a fourth assignment, nor was i sorry to break an emotional series that threatened to burden me with heartrending fantasies and peter out in dull disappointment. so let her remain, sleek, slender monique, as she was for a minute or two a delinquent nymphet shining through the matteroffact young whore.         my brief acquaintance with her started a train of thought that may seem pretty obvious to the reader who knows the ropes. an advertisement in a lewd magazine landed me, one brave day, in the office of a mlle edith who began by offering me to choose a kindred soul from a collection of rather formal photographs in a rather soiled album           regardezmoi cette belle brune. when i pushed the album away and somehow managed to blurt out my criminal craving, she looked as if about to show me the door however, after asking me what price i was prepared to disburse, she condescended to put me in touch with a person          qui pourrait arranger la chose. next day, an asthmatic woman, coarsely painted, garrulous, garlicky, with an almost farcical provenal accent and a black mustache above a purple lip, took me to what was apparently her own domicile, and there, after explosively kissing the bunched tips of her fat fingers to signify the delectable rosebud quality of her merchandise, she theatrically drew aside a curtain to reveal what i judged was that part of the room where a large and unfastidious family usually slept. it was now empty save for a monstrously plump, sallow, repulsively plain girl of at least fifteen with redribboned thick black braids who sat on a chair perfunctorily nursing a bald doll. when i shook my head and tried to shuffle out of the trap, the woman, talking fast, began removing the dingy woolen jersey from the young giantess torso then, seeing my determination to leave, she demanded          son argent.a door at the end of the room was opened, and two men who had been dining in the kitchen joined in the squabble. they were misshapen, barenecked, very swarthy and one of them wore dark glasses. a small boy and a begrimed, bowlegged toddler lurked behind them. with the insolent logic of a nightmare, the enraged procuress, indicating the man in glasses, said he had served in the police,          lui, so that i had better do as i was told. i went up to mariefor that was her stellar namewho by then had quietly transferred her heavy haunches to a stool at the kitchen table and resumed her interrupted soup while the toddler picked up the doll. with a surge of pity dramatizing my idiotic gesture, i thrust a banknote into her indifferent hand. she surrendered my gift to the exdetective, whereupon i was suffered to leave.                                             i do not know if the pimps album may not have beeen another link in the daisychain but soon after, for my own safety, i decided to marry. it occurred to me that regular hours, homecooked meals, all the conventions of marriage, the prophylactic routine of its bedroom activities and, who knows, the eventual flowering of certain moral values, of certain spiritual substitutes, might help me, if not to purge myself of my degrading and dangerous desires, at least to keep them under pacific control. a little money that had come my way after my fathers death nothing very grandthe mirana had been sold long before, in addition to my striking if somewhat brutal good looks, allowed me to enter upon my quest with equanimity. after considerable deliberation, my choice fell on the daughter of a polish doctor the good man happened to be treating me for spells of dizziness and tachycardia. we played chess his daughter watched me from behind her easel, and inserted eyes or knuckles borrowed from me into the cubistic trash that accomplished misses then painted instead of lilacs and lambs. let me repeat with quiet force i was, and still am, despite          mes malheurs, an exceptionally handsome male slowmoving, tall, with soft dark hair and a gloomy but all the more seductive cast of demeanor. exceptional virility often reflects in the subjects displayable features a sullen and congested something that pertains to what he has to conceal. and this was my case. well did i know, alas, that i could obtain at the snap of my fingers any adult female i chose in fact, it had become quite a habit with me of not being too attentive to women lest they come toppling, bloodripe, into my cold lap. had i been a          francais moyenwith a taste for flashy ladies, i might have easily found, among the many crazed beauties that lashed my grim rock, creatures far more fascinating than valeria. my choice, however, was prompted by considerations whose essence was, as i realized too late, a piteous compromise. all of which goes to show how dreadfully stupid poor humbert always was in matters of sex.                                             although i told myself i was looking merely for a soothing presence, a glorified          potaufeu, an animated merkin, what really attracted me to valeria was the imitation she gave of a little girl. she gave it not because she had divined something about me it was just her styleand i fell for it. actually, she was at least in her late twenties i never established her exact age for even her passport lied and had mislaid her virginity under circumstances that changed with her reminiscent moods. i, on my part, was as naive as only a pervert can be. she looked fluffy and frolicsome, dressed          a la gamine, showed a generous amount of smooth leg, knew how to stress the white of a bare instep by the black of a velvet slipper, and pouted, and dimpled, and romped, and dirndled, and shook her short curly blond hair in the cutest and tritest fashion imaginable.         after a brief ceremony at the          mairie, i tool her to the new apartment i had rented and, somewhat to her surprise, had her wear, before i touched her, a girls plain nightshirt that i had managed to filch from the linen closet of an orphanage. i derived some fun from that nuptial night and had the idiot in hysterics by sunrise. but reality soon asserted itself. the bleached curl revealed its melanic root the down turned to prickles on a shaved shin the mobile moist mouth, no matter how i stuffed it with love, disclosed ignominiously its resemblance to the corresponding part in a treasured portrait of her toadlike dead mama and presently, instead of a pale little gutter girl, humbert humbert had on his hands a large, puffy, shortlegged, bigbreasted and practically brainless          baba.         this state of affairs lasted from  to . her only asset was a muted nature which did help to produce an odd sense of comfort in our small squalid flat two rooms, a hazy view in one window, a brick wall in the other, a tiny kitchen, a shoeshaped bath tub, within which i felt like marat but with no whitenecked maiden to stab me. we had quite a few cozy evenings together, she deep in her          parissoir, i working at a rickety table. we went to movies, bicycle races and boxing matches. i appealed to her stale flesh very seldom, only in cases of great urgency and despair. the grocer opposite had a little daughter whose shadow drove me mad but with valerias help i did find after all some legal outlets to my fantastic predicament. as to cooking, we tacitly dismissed the          potaufeuand had most of our meals at a crowded place in rue bonaparte where there were wine stains on the table cloth and a good deal of foreign babble. and next door, an art dealer displayed in his cluttered window a splendid, flamboyant, green, red, golden and inky blue, ancient american estampea locomotive with a gigantic smokestack, great baroque lamps and a tremendous cowcatcher, hauling its mauve coaches through the stormy prairie night and mixing a lot of sparkstudded black smoke with the furry thunder clouds.         these burst. in the summer of           mon         oncle damriquedied bequeathing me an annual income of a few thousand dollars on condition i came to live in the states and showed some interest in his business. this prospect was most welcome to me. i felt my life needed a shakeup. there was another thing, too moth holes had appeared in the plush of matrimonial comfort. during the last weeks i had kept noticing that my fat valeria was not her usual self had acquired a queer restlessness even showed something like irritation at times, which was quite out of keeping with the stock character she was supposed to impersonate. when i informed her we were shortly to sail for new york, she looked distressed and bewildered. there were some tedious difficulties with her papers. she had a nansen, or better say nonsense, passport which for some reason a share in her husbands solid swiss citizenship could not easily transcend and i decided it was the necessity of queuing in the          prfecture, and other formalities, that had made her so listless, despite my patiently describing to her america, the country of rosy children and great trees, where life would be such an improvement on dull dingy paris.         we were coming out of some office building one morning, with her papers almost in order, when valeria, as she waddled by my side, began to shake her poodle head vigorously without saying a word. i let her go on for a while and then asked if she thought she had something inside. she answered i translate from her french which was, i imagine, a translation in its turn of some slavic platitude there is another man in my life.         now, these are ugly words for a husband to hear. they dazed me, i confess. to beat her up in the street, there and then, as an honest vulgarian might have done, was not feasible. years of secret sufferings had taught me superhuman selfcontrol. so i ushered her into a taxi which had been invitingly creeping along the curb for some time, and in this comparative privacy i quietly suggested she comment her wild talk. a mounting fury was suffocating menot because i had any particular fondness for that figure of fun,          mme humbert, but because matters of legal and illegal conjunction were for me alone to decide, and here she was, valeria, the comedy wife, brazenly preparing to dispose in her own way of my comfort and fate. i demanded her lovers name. i repeated my question but she kept up a burlesque babble, discoursing on her unhappiness with me and announcing plans for an immediate divorce.           mais qui estce i shouted at last, striking her on the knee with my fist and she, without even wincing, stared at me as if the answer were too simple for words, then gave a quick shrug and pointed at the thick neck of the taxi driver. he pulled up at a small caf and introduced himself. i do not remember his ridiculous name but after all those years i still see him quite clearlya stocky white russian excolonel with a bushy mustache and a crew cut there were thousands of them plying that fools trade in paris. we sat down at a table the tsarist ordered wine, and valeria, after applying a wet napkin to her knee, went on talking          intome rather than to me she poured words into this dignified receptacle with a volubility i had never suspected she had in her. and every now and then she would volley a burst of slavic at her stolid lover. the situation was preposterous and became even more so when the taxicolonel, stopping valeria with a possessive smile, began to unfold          hisviews and plans. with an atrocious accent to his careful french, he delineated the world of love and work into which he proposed to enter hand in hand with his childwife valeria. she by now was preening herself, between him and me, rouging her pursed lips, tripling her chin to pick at her blousebosom and so forth, and he spoke of her as if she were absent, and also as if she were a kind of little ward that was in the act of being transferred, for her own good, from one wise guardian to another even wiser one and although my helpless wrath may have exaggerated and disfigured certain impressions, i can swear that he actually consulted me on such things as her diet, her periods, her wardrobe and the books she had read or should read. i think,he said, she will like          jean christophe oh, he was quite a scholar, mr. taxovich.         i put an end to this gibberish by suggesting valeria pack up her few belongings immediately, upon which the platitudinous colonel gallantly offered to carry them into the car. reverting to his professional state, he drove the humberts to their residence and all the way valeria talked, and humbert the terrible deliberated with humbert the small whether humbert humbert should kill her or her lover, or both, or neither. i remember once handling an automatic belonging to a fellow student, in the days i have not spoken of them, i think, but never mind when i toyed with the idea of enjoying his little sister, a most diaphanous nymphet with a black hair bow, and then shooting myself. i now wondered if valechka as the colonel called her was really worth shooting, or strangling, or drowning. she had very vulnerable legs, and i decided i would limit myself to hurting her very horribly as soon as we were alone.         but we never were. valechkaby now shedding torrents of tears tinged with the mess of her rainbow makeup,started to fill anyhow a trunk, and two suitcases, and a bursting carton, and visions of putting on my mountain boots and taking a running kick at her rump were of course impossible to put into execution with the cursed colonel hovering around all the time. i cannot say he behaved insolently or anything like that on the contrary, he displayed, as a small sideshow in the theatricals i had been inveigled in, a discreet oldworld civility, punctuating his movements with all sorts of mispronounced apologies           jai demande pardonneexcuse me          estce que jai puismay iand so forth, and turning away tactfully when valechka took down with a flourish her pink panties from the clothesline above the tub but he seemed to be all over the place at once,          le gredin, agreeing his frame with the anatomy of the flat, reading in my chair my newspaper, untying a knotted string, rolling a cigarette, counting the teaspoons, visiting the bathroom, helping his moll to wrap up the electric fan her father had given her, and carrying streetward her luggage. i sat with arms folded, one hip on the window sill, dying of hate and boredom. at last both were out of the quivering apartmentthe vibration of the door i had slammed after them still rang in my every nerve, a poor substitute for the backhand slap with which i ought to have hit her across the cheekbone according to the rules of the movies. clumsily playing my part, i stomped to the bathroom to check if they had taken my english toilet water they had not but i noticed with a spasm of fierce disgust that the former counselor of the tsar, after thoroughly easing his bladder, had not flushed the toilet. that solemn pool of alien urine with a soggy, tawny cigarette butt disintegrating in it struck me as a crowning insult, and i wildly looked around for a weapon. actually i daresay it was nothing but middleclass russian courtesy with an oriental tang, perhaps that had prompted the good colonel maximovich his name suddenly taxies back to me, a very formal person as they all are, to muffle his private need in decorous silence so as not to underscore the small size of his hosts domicile with the rush of a gross cascade on top of his own hushed trickle. but this did not enter my mind at the moment, as groaning with rage i ransacked the kitchen for something better than a broom. then, canceling my search, i dashed out of the house with the heroic decision of attacking him barefisted despite my natural vigor, i am no pugilist, while the short but broadshouldered maximovich seemed made of pig iron. the void of the street, revealing nothing of my wifes departure except a rhinestone button that she had dropped in the mud after preserving it for three unnecessary years in a broken box, may have spared me a bloody nose. but no matter. i had my little revenge in due time. a man from pasadena told me one day that mrs. maximovich ne zborovski had died in childbirth around  the couple had somehow got over to california and had been used there, for an excellent salary, in a yearlong experiment conducted by a distinguished american ethnologist. the experiment dealt with human and racial reactions to a diet of bananas and dates in a constant position on all fours. my informant, a doctor, swore he had seen with his own eyes obese valechka and her colonel, by then grayhaired and also quite corpulent, diligently crawling about the wellswept floors of a brightly lit set of rooms fruit in one, water in another, mats in a third and so on in the company of several other hired quadrupeds, selected from indigent and helpless groups. i tried to find the results of these tests in the          review of anthropology but they appear not to have been published yet. these scientific products take of course some time to fructuate. i hope they will be illustrated with photographs when they do get printed, although it is not very likely that a prison library will harbor such erudite works. the one to which i am restricted these days, despite my lawyers favors, is a good example of the inane eclecticism governing the selection of books in prison libraries. they have the bible, of course, and dickens an ancient set, n.y., g.w. dillingham, publisher, mdccclxxxvii and the          childrens encyclopediawith some nice photographs of sunshinehaired girl scouts in shorts, and          a murder is announcedby agatha christie but they also have such coruscating trifles as          a vagabond in italyby percy elphinstone, author of          venice revisited, boston, , and a comparatively recent

                  divorce proceedings delayed my voyage, and the gloom of yet another world war had settled upon the globe when, after a winter of ennui and pneumonia in portugal, i at last reached the states. in new york i eagerly accepted the soft job fate offered me it consisted mainly of thinking up and editing perfume ads. i welcomed its desultory character and pseudoliterary aspects, attending to it whenever i had nothing better to do. on the other hand, i was urged by a wartime university in new york to complete my comparative history of french literature for englishspeaking students. the first volume took me a couple of years during which i put in seldom less than fifteen hours of work daily. as i look back on those days, i see them divided tidily into ample light and narrow shade the light pertaining to the solace of research in palatial libraries, the shade to my excruciating desires and insomnias of which enough has been said. knowing me by now, the reader can easily imagine how dusty and hot i got, trying to catch a glimpse of nymphets alas, always remote playing in central park, and how repulsed i was by the glitter of deodorized career girls that a gay dog in one of the offices kept unloading upon me. let us skip all that. a dreadful breakdown sent me to a sanatorium for more than a year i went back to my workonly to be hospitalized again.         robust outdoor life seemed to promise me some relief. one of my favorite doctors, a charming cynical chap with a little brown beard, had a brother, and this brother was about to lead an expedition into arctic canada. i was attached to it as a recorder of psychic reactions. with two young botanists and an old carpenter i shared now and then never very successfully the favors of one of our nutritionists, a dr. anita johnsonwho was soon flown back, i am glad to say. i had little notion of what object the expedition was pursuing. judging by the number of meteorologists upon it, we may have been tracking to its lair somewhere on prince of wales island, i understand the wandering and wobbly north magnetic pole. one group, jointly with the canadians, established a weather station on pierre point in melville sound. another group, equally misguided, collected plankton. a third studied tuberculosis in the tundra. bert, a film photographeran insecure fellow with whom at one time i was made to partake in a good deal of menial work he, too, had some psychic troublesmaintained that the big men on our team, the real leaders we never saw, were mainly engaged in checking the influence of climatic amelioration on the coats of the arctic fox.         we lived in prefabricated timber cabins amid a precambrian world of granite. we had heaps of suppliesthe          readers digest, an ice cream mixer, chemical toilets, paper caps for christmas. my health improved wonderfully in spite or because of all the fantastic blankness and boredom. surrounded by such dejected vegetation as willow scrub and lichens permeated, and, i suppose, cleansed by a whistling gale seated on a boulder under a completely translucent sky through which, however, nothing of importance showed, i felt curiously aloof from my own self. no temptations maddened me. the plump, glossy little eskimo girls with their fish smell, hideous raven hair and guinea pig faces, evoked even less desire in me than dr. johnson had. nymphets do not occur in polar regions.         i left my betters the task of analyzing glacial drifts, drumlins, and gremlins, and kremlins, and for a time tried to jot down what i fondly thought were reactions i noticed, for instance, that dreams under the midnight sun tended to be highly colored, and this my friend the photographer confirmed. i was also supposed to quiz my various companions on a number of important matters, such as nostalgia, fear of unknown animals, foodfantasies, nocturnal emissions, hobbies, choice of radio programs, changes in outlook and so forth. everybody got so fed up with this that i soon dropped the project completely, and only toward the end of my twenty months of cold labor as one of the botanists jocosely put it concocted a perfectly spurious and very racy report that the reader will find published in he          annals of adult psychophysicsfor  or , as well as in the issue of          arctic explorationsdevoted to that particular expedition which, in conclusion, was not really concerned with victoria island copper or anything like that, as i learned later from my genial doctor for the nature of its real purpose was what is termed hushhush, and so let me add merely that whatever it was, that purpose was admirably achieved.         the reader will regret to learn that soon after my return to civilization i had another bout with insanity if to melancholia and a sense of insufferable oppression that cruel term must be applied. i owe my complete restoration to a discovery i made while being treated at that particular very expensive sanatorium. i discovered there was an endless source of robust enjoyment in trifling with psychiatrists cunningly leading them on never letting them see that you know all the tricks of the trade inventing for them elaborate dreams, pure classics in style which make          them, the dreamextortionists, dream and wake up shrieking teasing them with fake primal scenes and never allowing them the slightest glimpse of ones real sexual predicament. by bribing a nurse i won access to some files and discovered, with glee, cards calling me potentially homosexual and totally impotent. the sport was so excellent, its resultsin          mycaseso ruddy that i stayed on for a whole month after i was quite well sleeping admirably and eating like a schoolgirl. and then i added another week just for the pleasure of taking on a powerful newcomer, a displaced and, surely, deranged celebrity, known for his knack of making patients believe they had witnessed their own conception.                                             upon signing out, i cast around for some place in the new england countryside or sleepy small town elms, white church where i could spend a studious summer subsisting on a compact boxful of notes i had accumulated and bathing in some nearby lake. my work had begun to interest me againi mean my scholarly exertions the other thing, my active participation in my uncles posthumous perfumes, had by then been cut down to a minimum.         one of his former employees, the scion of a distinguished family, suggested i spend a few months in the residence of his impoverished cousins, a mr. mccoo, retired, and his wife, who wanted to let their upper story where a late aunt had delicately dwelt. he said they had two little daughters, one a baby, the other a girl of twelve, and a beautiful garden, not far from a beautiful lake, and i said it sounded perfectly perfect.         i exchanged letters with these people, satisfying them i was housebroken, and spent a fantastic night on the train, imagining in all possible detail the enigmatic nymphet i would coach in french and fondle in humbertish. nobody met me at the toy station where i alighted with my new expensive bag, and nobody answered the telephone eventually, however, a distraught mccoo in wet clothes turned up at the only hotel of greenandpink ramsdale with the news that his house had just burned downpossibly, owing to the synchronous conflagration that had been raging all night in my veins. his family, he said, had fled to a farm he owned, and had taken the car, but a friend of his wifes, a grand person, mrs. haze of  lawn street, offered to accommodate me. a lady who lived opposite mrs. hazes had lent mccoo her limousine, a marvelously oldfashioned, squaretopped affair, manned by a cheerful negro. now, since the only reason for my coming at all had vanished, the aforesaid arrangement seemed preposterous. all right, his house would have to be completely rebuilt, so what had he not insured it sufficiently i was angry, disappointed and bored, but being a polite european, could not refuse to be sent off to lawn street in that funeral car, feeling that otherwise mccoo would devise an even more elaborate means of getting rid of me. i saw him scamper away, and my chauffeur shook his head with a soft chuckle. en route, i swore to myself i would not dream of staying in ramsdale under any circumstance but would fly that very day to the bermudas or the bahamas or the blazes. possibilities of sweetness on technicolor beaches had been trickling through my spine for some time before, and mccoos cousin had, in fact, sharply diverted that train of thought with his wellmeaning but as it transpired now absolutely inane suggestion.         speaking of sharp turns we almost ran over a meddlesome suburban dog one of those who like in wait for cars as we swerved into lawn street. a little further, the haze house, a whiteframe horror, appeared, looking dingy and old, more gray than whitethe kind of place you know will have a rubber tube affixable to the tub faucet in lieu of shower. i tipped the chauffeur and hoped he would immediately drive away so that i might double back unnoticed to my hotel and bag but the man merely crossed to the other side of the street where an old lady was calling to him from her porch. what could i do i pressed the bell button.         a colored maid let me inand left me standing on the mat while she rushed back to the kitchen where something was burning that ought not to burn.         the front hall was graced with door chimes, a whiteeyed wooden thingamabob of commercial mexican origin, and that banal darling of the arty middle class, van goghs arlsienne. a door ajar to the right afforded a glimpse of a living room, with some more mexican trash in a corner cabinet and a striped sofa along the wall. there was a staircase at the end of the hallway, and as i stood mopping my brow only now did i realize how hot it had been outofdoors and staring, to stare at something, at an old gray tennis ball that lay on an oak chest, there came from the upper landing the contralto voice of mrs. haze, who leaning over the banisters inquired melodiously, is that monsieur humbert a bit of cigarette ash dropped from there in addition. presently, the lady herselfsandals, maroon slacks, yellow silk blouse, squarish face, in that ordercame down the steps, her index finger still tapping upon her cigarette.         i think i had better describe her right away, to get it over with. the poor lady was in her middle thirties, she had a shiny forehead, plucked eyebrows and quite simple but not unattractive features of a type that may be defined as a weak solution of marlene dietrich. patting her bronzebrown bun, she led me into the parlor and we talked for a minute about the mccoo fire and the privilege of living in ramsdale. her very wideset seagreen eyes had a funny way of traveling all over you, carefully avoiding your own eyes. her smile was but a quizzical jerk of one eyebrow and uncoiling herself from the sofa as she talked, she kept making spasmodic dashes at three ashtrays and the near fender where lay the brown core of an apple whereupon she would sink back again, one leg folded under her. she was, obviously, one of those women whose polished words may reflect a book club or bridge club, or any other deadly conventionality, but never her soul women who are completely devoid of humor women utterly indifferent at heart to the dozen or so possible subjects of a parlor conversation, but very particular about the rules of such conversations, through the sunny cellophane of which not very appetizing frustrations can be readily distinguished. i was perfectly aware that if by any wild chance i became her lodger, she would methodically proceed to do in regard to me what taking a lodger probably meant to her all along, and i would again be enmeshed in one of those tedious affairs i knew so well.         but there was no question of my settling there. i could not be happy in that type of household with bedraggled magazines on every chair and a kind of horrible hybridization between the comedy of socalled functional modern furniture and the tragedy of decrepit rockers and rickety lamp tables with dead lamps. i was led upstairs, and to the leftinto my room. i inspected it through the mist of my utter rejection of it but i did discern above my bed ren prinets kreutzer sonata. and she called that servant maids room a semistudio lets get out of here at once, i firmly said to myself as i pretended to deliberate over the absurdly, and ominously, low price that my wistful hostess was asking for board and bed.         oldworld politeness, however, obliged me to go on with the ordeal. we crossed the landing to the right side of the house where i and lo have our roomslo being presumably the maid, and the lodgerlover could hardly conceal a shudder when he, a very fastidious male, was granted a preview of the only bathroom, a tiny oblong between the landing and los room, with limp wet things overhanging the dubious tub the question mark of a hair inside and there were the expected coils of the rubber snake, and its complementa pinkish cozy, coyly covering the toilet lid.         i see you are not too favorably impressed, said the lady letting her hand rest for a moment upon my sleeve she combined a cool forwardnessthe overflow of what i think is called poisewith a shyness and sadness that caused her detached way of selecting her words to seem as unnatural as the intonation of a professor of speech. this is not a neat household, i confess, the doomed ear continued, but i assure you she looked at my lips, you will be very comfortable, very comfortable, indeed. let me show you the garden the last more brightly, with a kind of winsome toss of the voice.         reluctantly i followed her downstairs again then through the kitchen at the end of the hall, on the right side of the housethe side where also the dining room and the parlor were under my room, on the left, there was nothing but a garage. in the kitchen, the negro maid, a plump youngish woman, said, as she took her large glossy black purse from the knob of the door leading to the back porch ill go now, mrs. haze. yes, louise, answered mrs. haze with a sigh. ill settle with you friday. we passed on to a small pantry and entered the dining room, parallel to the parlor we had already admired. i noticed a white sock on the floor. with a deprecatory grunt, mrs. haze stooped without stopping and threw it into a closet next to the pantry. we cursorily inspected a mahogany table with a fruit vase in the middle, containing nothing but the still glistening stone of one plum. i groped for the timetable i had in my pocket and surreptitiously fished it out to look as soon as possible for a train. i was still walking behind mrs. haze though the dining room when, beyond it, there came a sudden burst of greenerythe piazza, sang out my leader, and then, without the least warning, a blue seawave swelled under my heart and, from a mat in a pool of sun, halfnaked, kneeling, turning about on her knees, there was my riviera love peering at me over dark glasses.         it was the same childthe same frail, honeyhued shoulders, the same silky supple bare back, the same chestnut head of hair. a polkadotted black kerchief tied around her chest hid from my aging ape eyes, but not from the gaze of young memory, the juvenile breasts i had fondled one immortal day. and, as if i were the fairytale nurse of some little princess lost, kidnaped, discovered in gypsy rags through which her nakedness smiled at the king and his hounds, i recognized the tiny darkbrown mole on her side. with awe and delight the king crying for joy, the trumpets blaring, the nurse drunk i saw again her lovely indrawn abdomen where my southbound mouth had briefly paused and those puerile hips on which i had kissed the crenulated imprint left by the band of her shortsthat last mad immortal day behind the roches roses. the twentyfive years i had lived since then, tapered to a palpitating point, and vanished.         i find it most difficult to express with adequate force that flash, that shiver, that impact of passionate recognition. in the course of the sunshot moment that my glance slithered over the kneeling child her eyes blinking over those stern dark spectaclesthe little herr doktor who was to cure me of all my aches while i passed by her in my adult disguise a great big handsome hunk of movieland manhood, the vacuum of my soul managed to suck in every detail of her bright beauty, and these i checked against the features of my dead bride. a little later, of course, she,          thos nouvelle, this lolita,          mylolita, was to eclipse completely her prototype. all i want to stress is that my discovery of her was a fatal consequence of that princedom by the sea in my tortured past. everything between the two events was but a series of gropings and blunders, and false rudiments of joy. everything they shared made one of them.         i have no illusions, however. my judges will regard all this as a piece of mummery on the part of a madman with a gross liking for the          fruit vert.          au fond,         a         mest bien gal.all i now is that while the haze woman and i went down the steps into the breathless garden, my knees were like reflections of knees in rippling water, and my lips were like sand, and         that was my lo, she said, and these are my lilies.         yes, i said, yes. they are beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.                                             exhibit number two is a pocket diary bound in black imitation leather, with a golden year, ,          en escalier, in its upper lefthand corner. i speak of this neat product of the blank blank co., blankton, mass., as if it were really before me. actually, it was destroyed five years go and what we examine now by courtesy of a photographic memory is but its brief materialization, a puny unfledged phnix.         i remember the thing so exactly because i wrote it really twice. first i jotted down each entry in pencil with many erasures and corrections on the leaves of what is commercially known as a typewriter tablet then, i copied it out with obvious abbreviations in my smallest, most satanic, hand in the little black book just mentioned.         may  is a fast day by proclamation in new hampshire but not in the carolinas. that day an epidemic of abdominal flu whatever that is forced ramsdale to close its schools for the summer. the reader may check the weather data in the ramsdale          journalfor . a few days before that i moved into the haze house, and the little diary which i now propose to reel off much as a spy delivers by heart the contents of the note he swallowed covers most of june.                  thursday.very warm day. from a vantage point bathroom window saw dolores taking things off a clothesline in the applegreen light behind the house. strolled out. she wore a plaid shirt, blue jeans and sneakers. every movement she made in the dappled sun plucked at the most secret and sensitive chord of my abject body. after a while she sat down next to me on the lower step of the back porch and began to pick up the pebbles between her feetpebbles, my god, then a curled bit of milkbottle glass resembling a snarling lipand chuck them at a can.          ping         .you cant a second timeyou cant hit itoh, marvelous tender and tanned, not the least blemish. sundaes cause acne. the excess of the oily substance called sebum which nourishes the hair follicles of the skin creates, when too profuse, an irritation that opens the way to infection. but nymphets do not have acne although they gorge themselves on rich food. god, what agony, that silky shimmer above her temple grading into bright brown hair. and the little bone twitching at the side of her dustpowdered ankle. the mccoo girl ginny mccoo oh, shes a fright. and mean. and lame. nearly died of polio. ping. the glistening tracery of down on her forearm. when she got up to take in the wash, i had a chance of adoring from afar the faded seat of her rolledup jeans. out of the lawn, bland mrs. haze, complete with camera, grew up like a fakirs fake tree and after some heliotropic fussingsad eyes up, glad eyes downhad the cheek of taking my picture as i sat blinking on the steps, humbert le bel.                  friday.saw her going somewhere with a dark girl called rose. why does the way she walksa child, mind you, a mere childexcite me so abominably analyze it. a faint suggestion of turned in toes. a kind of wiggly looseness below the knee prolonged to the end of each footfall. the ghost of a drag. very infantile, infinitely meretricious. humbert humbert is also infinitely moved by the little ones slangy speech, by her harsh high voice. later heard her volley crude nonsense at rose across the fence. twanging through me in a rising rhythm. pause. i must go now, kiddo.                  saturday.beginning perhaps amended. i know it is madness to keep this journal but it gives me a strange thrill to do so and only a loving wife could decipher my microscopic script. let me state with a sob that today my l. was sunbathing on the socalled piazza, but her mother and some other woman were around all the time. of course, i might have sat there in the rocker and pretended to read. playing safe, i kept away, for i was afraid that the horrible, insane, ridiculous and pitiful tremor that palsied me might prevent me from making my          entrewith any semblance of casualness.                  sunday.heat ripple still with us a most favonian week. this time i took up a strategic position, with obese newspaper and new pipe, in the piazza rocker          beforel. arrived. to my intense disappointment she came with her mother, both in twopiece bathing suits, black, as new as my pipe. my darling, my sweetheart stood for a moment near mewanted the funniesand she smelt almost exactly like the other one, the riviera one, but more intensely so, with rougher overtonesa torrid odor that at once set my manhood astirbut she had already yanked out of me the coveted section and retreated to her mat near her phocine mamma. there my beauty lay down on her stomach, showing me, showing the thousand eyes wide open in my eyed blood, her slightly raised shoulder blades, and the bloom along the incurvation of her spine, and the swellings of her tense narrow nates clothed in black, and the seaside of her schoolgirl thighs. silently, the seventhgrader enjoyed her greenredblue comics. she was the loveliest nymphet greenredblue priap himself could think up. as i looked on, through prismatic layers of light, drylipped, focusing my lust and rocking slightly under my newspaper, i felt that my perception of her, if properly concentrated upon, might be sufficient to have me attain a beggars bliss immediately but, like some predator that prefers a moving prey to a motionless one, i planned to have this pitiful attainment coincide with the various girlish movements she made now and then as she read, such as trying to scratch the middle of her back and revealing a stippled armpitbut fat haze suddenly spoiled everything by turning to me and asking me for a light, and starting a makebelieve conversation about a fake book by some popular fraud.                  monday.         delectatio morosa.i spend my doleful days in dumps and dolors. we mother haze, dolores and i were to go to our glass lake this afternoon, and bathe, and bask but a nacreous morn degenerated at noon into rain, and lo made a scene.         the median age of pubescence for girls has been found to be thirteen years and nine months in new york and chicago. the age varies for individuals from ten, or earlier, to seventeen. virginia was not quite fourteen when harry edgar possessed her. he gave her lessons in algebra.          je mimagine cela.they spent their honeymoon at petersburg, fla. monsieur poepoe, as that boy in one of monsieur humbert humberts classes in paris called the poetpoet.         i have all the characteristics which, according to writers on the sex interests of children, start the responses stirring in a little girl cleancut jaw, muscular hand, deep sonorous voice, broad shoulder. moreover, i am said to resemble some crooner or actor chap on whom lo has a crush.                  tuesday. rain. lake of the rains. mamma out shopping. l., i knew, was somewhere quite near. in result of some stealthy maneuvering, i came across her in her mothers bedroom. prying her left eye open to get rid of a speck of something. checked frock. although i do love that intoxicating brown fragrance of hers, i really think she should wash her hair once in a while. for a moment, we were both in the same warm green bath of the mirror that reflected the top of a poplar with us in the sky. held her roughly by the shoulders, then tenderly by the temples, and turned her about. its right there, she said. i can feel it. swiss peasant would use the top of her tongue. lick it out yeth. shly try sure, she said. gently i pressed my quivering sting along her rolling salty eyeball. goodygoody, she said nictating. it          isgone. now the other you dope, she began, there is noth but here she noticed the pucker of my approaching lips. okay, she said cooperatively, and bending toward her warm upturned russet face somber humbert pressed his mouth to her fluttering eyelid. she laughed, and brushed past me out of the room. my heart seemed everywhere at once. never in my lifenot even when fondling my childlove in francenever         night. never have i experienced such agony. i would like to describe her face, her waysand i cannot, because my own desire for her blinds me when she is near. i am not used to being with nymphets, damn it. if i close my eyes i see but an immobilized fraction of her, a cinematographic still, a sudden smooth nether loveliness, as with one knee up under her tartan skirt she sits tying her shoe. dolores haze,          ne nontrez pas vos zhambes this is her mother who thinks she knows french.         a poet          mes heures, i composed a madrigal to the sootblack lashes of her palegray vacant eyes, to the five asymmetrical freckles on her bobbed nose, to the blond down of her brown limbs but i tore it up and cannot recall it today. only in the tritest of terms diary resumed can i describe los features i might say her hair is auburn, and her lips as red as licked red candy, the lower one prettily plumpoh, that i were a lady writer who could have her pose naked in a naked light but instead i am lanky, bigboned, woolychested humbert humbert, with thick black eyebrows and a queer accent, and a cesspoolful of rotting monsters behind his slow boyish smile. and neither is she the fragile child of a feminine novel. what drives me insane is the twofold nature of this nymphetof every nymphet, perhaps this mixture in my lolita of tender dreamy childishness and a kind of eerie vulgarity, stemming from the snubnosed cuteness of ads and magazine pictures, from the blurry pinkness of adolescent maidservants in the old country smelling of crushed daisies and sweat and from very young harlots disguised as children in provincial brothels and then again, all this gets mixed up with the exquisite stainless tenderness seeping through the musk and the mud, through the dirt and the death, oh god, oh god. and what is most singular is that she,          thislolita,          mylolita, has individualized the writers ancient lust, so that above and over everything there islolita.                  wednesday.look, make mother take you and me to our glass lake tomorrow. these were the textual words said to me by my twelveyearold flame in a voluptuous whisper, as we happened to bump into one another on the front porch, i out, she in. the reflection of the afternoon sun, a dazzling white diamond with innumerable iridescent spikes quivered on the round back of a parked car. the leafage of a voluminous elm played its mellow shadows upon the clapboard wall of the house. two poplars shivered and shook. you could make out the formless sounds of remote traffic a child calling nancy, nancy in the house, lolita had put on her favorite little carmen record which i used to call dwarf conductors, making her snort with mock derision at my mock wit.                  thursday.last night we sat on the piazza, the haze woman, lolita and i. warm dusk had deepened into amorous darkness. the old girl had finished relating in great detail the plot of a movie she and l. had seen sometime in the winter. the boxer had fallen extremely low when he met the good old priest who had been a boxer himself in his robust youth and could still slug a sinner. we sat on cushions heaped on the floor, and l. was between the woman and me she had squeezed herself in, the pet. in my turn, i launched upon a hilarious account of my arctic adventures. the muse of invention handed me a rifle and i shot a white bear who sat down and said ah all the while i was acutely aware of l.s nearness and as i spoke i gestured in the merciful dark and took advantage of those invisible gestures of mine to touch her hand, her shoulder and a ballerina of wool and gauze which she played with and kept sticking into my lap and finally, when i had completely enmeshed my glowing darling in this weave of ethereal caresses, i dared stroke her bare leg along the gooseberry fuzz of her shin, and i chuckled at my own jokes, and trembled, and concealed my tremors, and once or twice felt with my rapid lips the warmth of her hair as i treated her to a quick nuzzling, humorous aside and caressed her plaything. she, too, fidgeted a good deal so that finally her mother told her sharply to quit it and sent the doll flying into the dark, and i laughed and addressed myself to haze across los legs to let my hand creep up my nymphets thin back and feel her skin through her boys shirt.         but i knew it was all hopeless, and was sick with longing, and my clothes felt miserably tight, and i was almost glad when her mothers quiet voice announced in the dark and now we all think that lo should go to bed. i think you stink, said lo. which means there will be no picnic tomorrow, said haze. this is a free country, said lo. when angry lo with a bronx cheer had gone, i stayed on from sheer inertia, while haze smoked her tenth cigarette of the evening and complained of lo.         she had been spiteful, if you please, at the age of one, when she used to throw her toys out of her crib so that her poor mother should keep picking them up, the villainous infant now, at twelve, she was a regular pest, said haze. all she wanted from life was to be one day a strutting and prancing baton twirler or a jitterbug. her grades were poor, but she was better adjusted in her new school than in pisky pisky was the haze home town in the middle west. the ramsdale house was her late motherinlaws. they had moved to ramsdale less than two years ago. why was she unhappy there oh, said haze, poor me should know, i went through that when          iwas a kid boys twisting ones arm, banging into one with loads of books, pulling ones hair, hurting ones breasts, flipping ones skirt. of course, moodiness is a common concomitant of growing up, but lo exaggerates. sullen and evasive. rude and defiant. struck viola, an italian schoolmate, in the seat with a fountain pen. know what i would like if you, monsieur, happened to be still here in the fall, id ask you to help her with her homeworkyou seem to know everything, geography, mathematics, french. oh, everything, answered monsieur. that means, said haze quickly, youll          behere i wanted to shout that i would stay on eternally if only i could hope to caress now and then my incipient pupil. but i was wary of haze. so i just grunted and stretched my limbs nonconcomitantly           le mot juste and presently went up to my room. the woman, however, was evidently not prepared to call it a day. i was already lying upon my cold bed both hands pressing to my face lolitas fragrant ghost when i heard my indefatigable landlady creeping stealthily up to my door to whisper through itjust to make sure, she said, i was through with the glance and gulp magazine i had borrowed the other day. from her room lo yelled          shehad it. we are quite a lending library in this house, thunder of god.                  friday.i wonder what my academic publishers would say if i were to quote in my textbook ronsards           la vermeillette fente or remy belleaus           un petit mont feutr de mousse dlicate, trac sur le milieu dun fillet escarlatte and so forth. i shall probably have another breakdown if i stay any longer in this house, under the strain of this intolerable temptation, by the side of my darlingmy darlingmy life and my bride. has she already been initiated by mother nature to the mystery of the menarche bloated feelings. the curse of the irish. falling from the roof. grandma is visiting. mr. uterus i quote from a girls magazine starts to build a thick soft wall on the chance a possible baby may have to be bedded down there. the tiny madman in his padded cell.         incidentally if i ever commit a serious murder mark the if. the urge should be something more than the kind of thing that happened to me with valeria. carefully mark that          thenwas rather inept. if and when you wish to sizzle me to death, remember that only a spell of insanity could ever give me the simple energy to be a brute all this amended, perhaps. sometimes i attempt to kill in my dreams. but do you know what happens for instance i hold a gun. for instance i aim at a bland, quietly interested enemy. oh, i press the trigger all right, but one bullet after another feebly drops on the floor from the sheepish muzzle. in those dreams, my only thought is to conceal the fiasco from my foe, who is slowly growing annoyed.         at dinner tonight the old cat said to me with a sidelong gleam of motherly mockery directed at lo i had just been describing, in a flippant vein, the delightful little toothbrush mustache i had not quite decided to grow better dont if somebody is not to go absolutely dotty. instantly lo pushed her plate of boiled fish away, all but knocking her milk over, and bounced out of the dining room. would it bore you very much, quoth haze, to come with us tomorrow for a swim in our glass lake if lo apologizes for her manners         later, i heard a great banging of doors and other sounds coming from quaking caverns where the two rivals were having a ripping row.         she had not apologized. the lake is out. it might have been fun.                  saturday.for some days already i had been leaving the door ajar, while i wrote in my room but only today did the trap work. with a good deal of additional fidgeting, shuffling, scrapingto disguise her embarrassment at visiting me without having been calledlo came in and after pottering around, became interested in the nightmare curlicues i had penned on a sheet of paper. oh no they were not the outcome of a bellelettrists inspired pause between two paragraphs they were the hideous hieroglyphics which she could not decipher of my fatal lust. as she bent her brown curs over the desk at which i was sitting, humbert the hoarse put his arm around her in a miserable imitation of bloodrelationship and still studying, somewhat shortsightedly, the piece of paper she held, my innocent little visitor slowly sank to a halfsitting position upon my knee. her adorable profile, parted lips, warm hair were some three inches from my bared eyetooth and i felt the heat of her limbs through her rough tomboy clothes. all at once i knew i could kiss her throat or the wick of her mouth with perfect impunity. i knew she would let me do so, and even close her eyes as hollywood teaches. a double vanilla with hot fudgehardly more unusual than that. i cannot tell my learned reader whose eyebrows, i suspect, have by now traveled all the way to the back of his bald head, i cannot tell him how the knowledge came to me perhaps my apeear had unconsciously caught some slight change in the rhythm of her respirationfor now she was not really looking at my scribble, but waiting with curiosity and composureoh, my limpid nymphetfor the glamorous lodger to do what he was dying to do. a modern child, an avid reader of movie magazines, an expert in dreamslow closeups, might not think it too strange, i guessed, if a handsome, intensely virile grownup friendtoo late. the house was suddenly vibrating with voluble louises voice telling mrs. haze who had just come home about a dead something she and leslie tomson had found in the basement, and little lolita was not one to miss such a tale.                  sunday.changeful, badtempered, cheerful, awkward, graceful with the tart grace of her coltish subteens, excruciatingly desirable from head to foot all new england for a ladywriters pen, from the black readmade bow and bobby pins holding her hair in place to the little scar on the lower part of her neat calf where a rollerskater kicked her in pisky, a couple of inches above her rough white sock. gone with her mother to the hamiltonsa birthday party or something. fullskirted gingham frock. her little doves seem well formed already. precocious pet                  monday.rainy morning.           ces matins         gris         si doux my white pajamas have a lilac design on the back. i am like one of those inflated pale spiders you see in old gardens. sitting in the middle of a luminous web and giving little jerks to this or that strand.          myweb is spread all over the house as i listen from my chair where i sit like a wily wizard. is lo in her room gently i tug on the silk. she is not. just heard the toilet paper cylinder make its staccato sound as it is turned and no footfalls has my outflung filament traced from the bathroom back to her room. is she still brushing her teeth the only sanitary act lo performs with real zest no. the bathroom door has just slammed, so one has to feel elsewhere about the house for the beautiful warmcolored prey. let us have a strand of silk descend the stairs. i satisfy myself by this means that she is not in the kitchennot banging the refrigerator door or screeching at her detested mamma who, i suppose, is enjoying her third, cooing and subduedly mirthful, telephone conversation of the morning. well, let us grope and hope. raylike, i glide in through to the parlor and find the radio silent and mamma still talking to mrs. chatfield or mrs. hamilton, very softly, flushed, smiling, cupping the telephone with her free hand, denying by implication that she denies those amusing rumors, rumor, roomer, whispering intimately, as she never does, the clearcut lady, in face to face talk. so my nymphet is not in the house at all gone what i thought was a prismatic weave turns out to be but an old gray cobweb, the house is empty, is dead. and then comes lolitas soft sweet chuckle through my halfopen door dont tell mother but ive eaten          allyour bacon. gone when i scuttle out of my room. lolita, where are you my breakfast tray, lovingly prepared by my landlady, leers at me toothlessly, ready to be taken in. lola, lolita                  tuesday.clouds again interfered with that picnic on that unattainable lake. is it fate scheming yesterday i tried on before the mirror a new pair of bathing trunks.                  wednesday.in the afternoon, haze commonsensical shoes, tailormade dress, said she was driving downtown to buy a present for a friend of a friend of hers, and would i please come too because i have such a wonderful taste in textures and perfumes. choose your favorite seduction, she purred. what could humbert, being in the perfume business, do she had me cornered between the front porch and her car. hurry up, she said as i laboriously doubled up my large body in order to crawl in still desperately devising a means of escape. she had started the engine, and was genteelly swearing at a backing and turning truck in front that had just brought old invalid miss opposite a brand new wheel chair, when my lolitas sharp voice came from the parlor window you where are you going im coming too wait ignore her, yelped haze killing the motor alas for my fair driver lo was already pulling at the door on my side. this is intolerable, began haze but lo had scrambled in, shivering with glee. move your bottom, you, said lo. lo cried haze sideglancing at me, hoping i would throw rude lo out. and behold, said lo not for the first time, as she jerked back, as i jerked back, as the car leapt forward. it is intolerable, said haze, violently getting into second, that a child should be so illmannered. and so very persevering. when she knows she is unwanted. and needs a bath.         my knuckles lay against the childs blue jeans. she was barefooted her toenails showed remnants of cherryred polish and there was a bit of adhesive tape across her big toe and, god, what would i not have given to kiss then and there those delicateboned, longtoed, monkeyish feet suddenly her hand slipped into mine and without our chaperons seeing, i held, and stroked, and squeezed that little hot paw, all the way to the store. the wings of the divers marlenesque nose shone, having shed or burned up their ration of powder, and she kept up an elegant monologue anent the local traffic, and smiled in profile, and pouted in profile, and beat her painted lashes in profile, while i prayed we would never get to that store, but we did.         i have nothing else to report, save,          primothat big haze had little haze sit behind on our way home, and          secundothat the lady decided to keep humberts choice for the backs of her own shapely ears.                  thursday.we are paying with hail and gale for the tropical beginning of the month. in a volume of the          young peoples encyclopedia, i found a map of the states that a childs pencil had started copying out on a sheet of lightweight paper, upon the other side of which, counter to the unfinished outline of florida and the gulf, there was a mimeographed list of names referring, evidently, to her class at the ramsdale school. it is a poem i know already by heart.                                 angel, grace             austin, floyd             beale, jack             beale, mary             buck, daniel             byron,

and sweet was it to discover this haze, dolores she in its special bower of names, with its bodyguard of rosesa fairy princess between her two maids of honor. i am trying to analyze the spinethrill of delight it gives me, this name among all those others. what is it that excites me almost to tears hot, opalescent, thick tears that poets and lovers shed what is it the tender anonymity of this name with its formal veil dolores and that abstract transposition of first name and surname, which is like a pair of new pale gloves or a mask is mask the keyword is it because there is always delight in the semitranslucent mystery, the flowing charshaf, through which the flesh and the eye you alone are elected to know smile in passing at you alone or is it because i can imagine so well the rest of the colorful classroom around my dolorous and hazy darling grace and her ripe pimples ginny and her lagging leg gordon, the haggard masturbator duncan, the foulsmelling clown nailbiting agnes viola, of the blackheads and the bouncing bust pretty rosaline dark mary rose adorable stella, who has let strangers touch her ralph, who bullies and steals irving, for whom i am sorry. and there she is there, lost in the middle, gnawing a pencil, detested by teachers, all the boys eyes on her hair and neck,          mylolita.                  friday.i long for some terrific disaster. earthquake. spectacular explosion. her mother is messily but instantly and permanently eliminated, along with everybody else for miles around. lolita whimpers in my arms. a free man, i enjoy her among the ruins. her surprise, my explanations, demonstrations, ullulations. idle and idiotic fancies a brave humbert would have played with her most disgustingly yesterday, for instance, when she was again in my room to show me her drawings, schoolartware he might have bribed herand got away with it. a simpler and more practical fellow would have soberly stuck to various commercial substitutesif you know where to go, i dont. despite my many looks, i am horribly timid. my romantic soul gets all clammy and shivery at the thought of running into some awful indecent unpleasantness. those ribald sea monsters.           mais allezy, allezy annabel skipping on one foot to get into her shorts, i seasick with rage, trying to screen her.         same date, later, quite late. i have turned on the light to take down a dream. it had an evident antecedent. haze at dinner had benevolently proclaimed that since the weather bureau promised a sunny weekend we would go to the lake sunday after church. as i lay in bed, erotically musing before trying to go to sleep, i thought of a final scheme how to profit by the picnic to come. i was aware that mother haze hated my darling for her being sweet on me. so i planned my lake day with a view to satisfying the mother. to her alone would i talk but at some appropriate moment i would say i had left my wrist watch or my sunglasses in that glade yonderand plunge with my nymphet into the wood. reality at this juncture withdrew, and the quest for the glasses turned into a quiet little orgy with a singularly knowing, cheerful, corrupt and compliant lolita behaving as reason knew she could not possibly behave. at  a.m. i swallowed a sleeping pill, and presently, a dream that was not a sequel but a parody revealed to me, with a kind of meaningful clarity, the lake i had never yet visited it was glazed over with a sheet of emerald ice, and a pockmarked eskimo was trying in vain to break it with a pickax, although imported mimosas and oleanders flowered on its gravelly banks. i am sure dr. blanche schwarzmann would have paid me a sack of schillings for adding such a libidream to her files. unfortunately, the rest of it was frankly eclectic. big haze and little haze rode on horseback around the lake, and i rode too, dutifully bobbing up and down, bowlegs astraddle although there was no horse between them, only elastic airone of those little omissions due to the absentmindedness of the dream agent.                  saturday. my heart is still thumping. i still squirm and emit low moans of remembered embarrassment.         dorsal view. glimpse of shiny skin between tshirt and white gym shorts. bending, over a window sill, in the act of tearing off leaves from a poplar outside while engrossed in torrential talk with a newspaper boy below kenneth knight, i suspect who had just propelled the ramsdale          journalwith a very precise thud onto the porch. i began creeping up to hercrippling up to her as pantomimists say. my arms and legs were convex surfaces between whichrather than upon whichi slowly progressed by some neutral means of locomotion humbert the wounded spider. i must have taken hours to reach her i seemed to see her through the wrong end of a telescope, and toward her taut little rear i moved like some paralytic, on soft distorted limbs, in terrible concentration. at last i was right behind her when i had the unfortunate idea of blustering a trifleshaking her by the scruff of the neck and that sort of thing to cover my real          mange, and she said in a shrill brief whine cut it outmost coarsely, the little wench, and with a ghastly grin humbert the humble beat a gloomy retreat while she went on wisecracking streetward.         but now listen to what happened next. after lunch i was reclining in a low chair trying to read. suddenly two deft little hands were over my eyes she had crept up from behind as if reenacting, in a ballet sequence, my morning maneuver. her fingers were a luminous crimson as they tried to blot out the sun, and she uttered hiccups of laughter and jerked this way and that as i stretched my arm sideways and backwards without otherwise changing my recumbent position. my hand swept over her agile giggling legs, and the book like a sleigh left my lap, and mrs. haze strolled up and said indulgently just slap her hard if she interferes with your scholarly meditations. how i love this garden no exclamation mark in her tone. isnt it divine in the sun no question mark either. and with a sign of feigned content, the obnoxious lady sank down on the grass and looked up at the sky as she leaned back on her splayedout hands, and presently an old gray tennis ball bounced over her, and los voice came from the house haughtily           pardonnez,mother. i was not aiming at          you. of course not, my hot downy darling.                                             this proved to be the last of twenty entries or so. it will be seem from them that for all the devils inventiveness, the scheme remained daily the same. first he would tempt meand then thwart me, leaving me with a dull pain in the very root of my being. i knew exactly what i wanted to do, and how to do it, without impinging on a childs chastity after all, i had had          someexperience in my life of pederosis had visually possessed dappled nymphets in parks had wedged my wary and bestial way into the hottest, most crowded corner of a city bus full of straphanging school children. but for almost three weeks i had been interrupted in all my pathetic machinations. the agent of these interruptions was usually the haze woman who, as the reader will mark, was more afraid of los deriving some pleasure from me than of my enjoying lo. the passion i had developed for that nymphetfor the first nymphet in my life that could be reached at last by my awkward, aching, timid clawswould have certainly landed me again in a sanatorium, had not the devil realized that i was to be granted some relief if he wanted to have me as a plaything for some time longer.         the reader has also marked the curious mirage of the lake. it would have been logical on the part of aubrey mcfate as i would like to dub that devil of mine to arrange a small treat for me on the promised beach, in the presumed forest. actually, the promise mrs. haze had made was a fraudulent one she had not told me that mary rose hamilton a dark little beauty in her own right was to come too, and that the two nymphets would be whispering apart, and playing apart, and having a good time all by themselves, while mrs. haze and her handsome lodger conversed sedately in the seminude, far from prying eyes. incidentally, eyes did pry and tongues did wag. how queer life is we hasten to alienate the very fates we intended to woo. before my actual arrival, my landlady had planned to have an old spinster, a miss phalen, whose mother had been cook in mrs. hazes family, come to stay in the house with lolita and me, while mrs. haze, a career girl at heart, sought some suitable job in the nearest city. mrs. haze had seen the whole situation very clearly the bespectacled, roundbacked herr humbert coming with his centraleuropean trunks to gather dust in his corner behind a heap of old books the unloved ugly little daughter firmly supervised by miss phalen who had already once had my lo under her buzzard wing lo recalled that  summer with an indignant shudder and mrs. haze herself engaged as a receptionist in a great elegant city. but a not too complicated event interfered with that program. miss phalen broke her hip in savannah, ga., on the very day i arrived in ramsdale.                                             the sunday after the saturday already described proved to be as bright as the weatherman had predicted. when putting the breakfast things back on the chair outside my room for my good landlady to remove at her convenience, i gleaned the following situation by listening from the landing across which i had softly crept to the banisters in my old bedroom slippersthe only old things about me.         there had been another row. mrs. hamilton had telephoned that her daughter was running a temperature. mrs. haze informed          herdaughter that the picnic would have to be postponed. hot little haze informed big cold haze that, if so, she would not go with her to church. mother said very well and left.         i had come out on the landing straight after shaving, soapyearlobed, still in my white pajamas with the cornflower blue not the lilac design on the back i now wiped off the soap, perfumed my hair and armpits, slipped on a purple silk dressing gown, and, humming nervously, went down the stairs in quest of lo.         i want my learned readers to participate in the scene i am about to replay i want them to examine its every detail and see for themselves how careful, how chaste, the whole winesweet event is if viewed with what my lawyer has called, in a private talk we have had, impartial sympathy. so let us get started. i have a difficult job before me.         main character humbert the hummer. time sunday morning in june. place sunlit living room. props old, candystriped davenport, magazines, phonograph, mexican knickknacks the late mr. harold e. hazegod bless the good manhad engendered my darling at the siesta hour in a bluewashed room, on a honeymoon trip to vera cruz, and mementoes, among these dolores, were all over the place. she wore that day a pretty print dress that i had seen on her once before, ample in the skirt, tight in the bodice, shortsleeved, pink, checkered with darker pink, and, to complete the color scheme, she had painted her lips and was holding in her hollowed hands a beautiful, banal, edenred apple. she was not shod, however, for church. and her white sunday purse lay discarded near the phonograph.         my heart beat like a drum as she sat down, cool skirt ballooning, subsiding, on the sofa next to me, and played with her glossy fruit. she tossed it up into the sundusted air, and caught itit made a cupped polished          plot.         humbert humbert intercepted the apple.         give it back,she pleaded, showing the marbled flush of her palms. i produced delicious. she grasped it and bit into it, and my heart was like snow under thin crimson skin, and with the nonkeyish nimbleness that was so typical of that american nymphet, she snatched out of my abstract grip the magazine i had opened pity no film had recorded the curious pattern, the monogrammic linkage of our simultaneous or overlapping moves. rapidly, hardly hampered by the disfigured apple she held, lo flipped violently through the pages in search of something she wished humbert to see. found it at last. i faked interest by bringing my head so close that her hair touched my temple and her arm brushed my cheek as she wiped her lips with her wrist. because of the burnished mist through which i peered at the picture, i was slow in reacting to it, and her bare knees rubbed and knocked impatiently against each other. dimly there came into view a surrealist painter relaxing, supine, on a beach, and near him, likewise supine, a plaster replica of the venus di milo, halfburied in sand. picture of the week, said the legend. i whisked the whole obscene thing away. next moment, in a sham effort to retrieve it, she was all over me. caught her by her thin knobby wrist. the magazine escaped to the floor like a flustered fowl. she twisted herself free, recoiled, and lay back in the righthand corner of the davenport. then, with perfect simplicity, the impudent child extended her legs across my lap.         by this time i was in a state of excitement bordering on insanity but i also had the cunning of the insane. sitting there, on the sofa, i managed to attune, by a series of stealthy movements, my masked lust to her guileless limbs. it was no easy matter to divert the little maidens attention while i performed the obscure adjustments necessary for the success of the trick. talking fast, lagging behind my own breath, catching up with it, mimicking a sudden toothache to explain the breaks in my patterand all the while keeping a maniacs inner eye on my distant golden goal, i cautiously increased the magic friction that was doing away, in an illusional, if not factual, sense, with the physically irremovable, but psychologically very friable texture of the material divide pajamas and robe between the weight of two sunburnt legs, resting athwart my lap, and the hidden tumor of an unspeakable passion. having, in the course of my patter, hit upon something nicely mechanical, i recited, garbling them slightly, the words of a foolish song that was then popularo my carmen, my little carmen, something, something, those something nights, and the stars, and the cars, and the bars, and the barmen i kept repeating this automatic stuff and holding her under its special spell spell because of the garbling, and all the while i was mortally afraid that some act of god might interrupt me, might remove the golden load in the sensation of which all my being seemed concentrated, and this anxiety forced me to work, for the first minute or so, more hastily than was consensual with deliberately modulated enjoyment. the stars that sparkled, and the cars that parkled, and the bars, and the barmen, were presently taken over by her her voice stole and corrected the tune i had been mutilating. she was musical and applesweet. her legs twitched a little as they lay across my live lap i stroked them there she lolled in the righthand corner, almost asprawl, lola the bobbysoxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice, losing her slipper, rubbing the heel of her slipperless foot in its sloppy anklet, against the pile of old magazines heaped on my left on the sofaand every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beautybetween my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock.         under my glancing finger tips i felt the minute hairs bristle ever so slightly along her shins. i lost myself in the pungent but healthy heat which like summer haze hung about little haze. let her stay, let her stay as she strained to chuck the core of her abolished apple into the fender, her young weight, her shameless innocent shanks and round bottom, shifted in my tense, tortured, surreptitiously laboring lap and all of a sudden a mysterious change came over my senses. i entered a plane of being where nothing mattered, save the infusion of joy brewed within my body. what had begun as a delicious distention of my innermost roots became a glowing tingle which          nowhad reached that state of absolute security, confidence and reliance not found elsewhere in conscious life. with the deep hot sweetness thus established and well on its way to the ultimate convulsion, i felt i could slow down in order to prolong the glow. lolita had been safely solipsized. the implied sun pulsated in the supplied poplars we were fantastically and divinely alone i watched her, rosy, golddusted, beyond the veil of my controlled delight, unaware of it, alien to it, and the sun was on her lips, and her lips were apparently still forming the words of the carmenbarmen ditty that no longer reached my consciousness. everything was now ready. the nerves of pleasure had been laid bare. the corpuscles of krause were entering the phase of frenzy. the least pressure would suffice to set all paradise loose. i had ceased to be humbert the hound, the sadeyed degenerate cur clasping the boot that would presently kick him away. i was above the tribulations of ridicule, beyond the possibilities of retribution. in my selfmade seraglio, i was a radiant and robust turk, deliberately, in the full consciousness of his freedom, postponing the moment of actually enjoying the youngest and frailest of his slaves. suspended on the brink of that voluptuous abyss a nicety of physiological equipoise comparable to certain techniques in the arts i kept repeating the chance words after herbarmen, alarmin, my charmin, my carmen, ahmen, ahahamenas one talking and laughing in his sleep while my happy hand crept up her sunny leg as far as the shadow of decency allowed. the day before she had collided with the heavy chest in the hall andlook, looki gaspedlook what youve done, what youve done to yourself, ah, look for there was, i swear, a yellowishviolet bruise on her lovely nymphet thigh which my huge hairy hand massaged and slowly envelopedand because of her very perfunctory underthings, there seemed to be nothing to prevent my muscular thumb from reaching the hot hollow of her groinjust as you might tickle and caress a giggling childjust thatand oh, its nothing at all, she cried with a sudden shrill note in her voice, and she wiggled, and squirmed, and threw her head back, and her teeth rested on her glistening underlip as she halfturned away, and my moaning mouth, gentlemen of the jury, almost reached her bare neck, while i crushed out against her left buttock the last throb of the longest ecstasy man or monster had ever known.         immediately afterward as if we had been struggling and now my grip had eased she rolled off the sofa and jumped to her feetto her foot, ratherin order to attend to the formidably loud telephone that may have been ringing for ages as far as i was concerned. there she stood and blinked, cheeks aflame, hair awry, her eyes passing over me as lightly as they did over the furniture, and as she listened or spoke to her mother who was telling her to come to lunch with her at the chatfiledsneither lo nor hum knew yet what busybody haze was plotting, she kept tapping the edge of the table with the slipper she held in her hand. blessed be the lord, she had noticed nothing         with a handkerchief of multicolored silk, on which her listening eyes rested in passing, i wiped the sweat off my forehead, and, immersed in a euphoria of release, rearranged my royal robes. she was still at the telephone, haggling with her mother wanted to be fetched by car, my little carmen when, singing louder and louder, i swept up the stairs and set a deluge of steaming water roaring into the tub.         at this point i may as well give the words of that song hit in fullto the best of my recollection at leasti dont think i ever had it right. here goes         o my carmen, my little carmen         something, something those something nights,         and the stars, and the cars, and the bars and the barmen         and, o my charmin, our dreadful fights.         and the something town where so gaily, arm in         arm, we went, and our final row,         and the gun i killed you with, o my carmen,         the gun i am holding now.         drew his . automatic, i guess, and put a bullet through his molls eye.                                             i had lunch in townhad not been so hungry for years. the house was still loless when i strolled back. i spent the afternoon musing, scheming, blissfully digesting my experience of the morning.         i felt proud of myself. i had stolen the honey of a spasm without impairing the morals of a minor. absolutely no harm done. the conjurer had poured milk, molasses, foaming champagne into a young ladys new white purse and lo, the purse was intact. thus had i delicately constructed my ignoble, ardent, sinful dream and still lolita was safeand i was safe. what i had madly possessed was not she, but my own creation, another, fanciful lolitaperhaps, more real than lolita overlapping, encasing her floating between me and her, and having no will, no consciousnessindeed, no life of her own.         the child knew nothing. i had done nothing to her. and nothing prevented me from repeating a performance that affected her as little as if she were a photographic image rippling upon a screen and i a humble hunchback abusing myself in the dark. the afternoon drifted on and on, in ripe silence, and the sappy tall trees seemed to be in the know and desire, even stronger than before, began to afflict me again. let her come soon, i prayed, addressing a loan god, and while mamma is in the kitchen, let a repetition of the davenport scene be staged, please, i adore her so horribly.         no horribly is the wrong word. the elation with which the vision of new delights filled me was not horrible but pathetic. i qualify it as pathetic. patheticbecause despite the insatiable fire of my venereal appetite, i intended, with the most fervent force and foresight, to protect the purity of that twelveyearold child.         and now see how i was repaid for my pains. no lolita came homeshe had gone with the chatfields to a movie. the table was laid with more elegance than usual candlelight, if you please. in this mawkish aura, mrs. haze gently touched the silver on both sides of her plate as if touching piano keys, and smiled down on her empty plate was on a diet, and said she hoped i liked the salad recipe lifted from a womans magazine. she hoped i liked the cold cuts, too. it had been a perfect day. mrs. chatfield was a lovely person. phyllis, her daughter, was going to a summer camp tomorrow. for three weeks. lolita, it was decided, would go thursday. instead of waiting till july, as had been initially planned. and stay there after phyllis had left. till school began. a pretty prospect, my heart.         oh, how i was taken abackfor did it not mean i was losing my darling, just when i had secretly made her mine to explain my grim mood, i had to use the same toothache i had already simulated in the morning. must have been an enormous molar, with an abscess as big as a maraschino cherry.         we have, said haze, an excellent dentist. our neighbor, in fact. dr. quilty. uncle or cousin, i think, of the playwright. think it will pass well, just as you wish. in the fall i shall have him brace her, as my mother used to say. it may curb lo a little. i am afraid she has been bothering you frightfully all these days. and we are in for a couple of stormy ones before she goes. she has flatly refused to go, and i confess i left her with the chatfields because i dreaded to face her alone just yet. the movie may mollify her. phyllis is a very sweet girl, and there is no earthly reason for lo to dislike her. really, monsieur, i am very sorry about that tooth of yours. it would be so much more reasonable to let me contact ivor quilty first thing tomorrow morning if it still hurts. and, you know, i think a summer camp is so much healthier, andwell, it is all so much more          reasonableas i say than to mope on a suburban lawn and use mammas lipstick, and pursue shy studious gentlemen, and go into tantrums at the least provocation.         are you sure, i said at last, that she will be happy there lame, lamentably lame         shed better, said haze. and it wont be all play either. the camp is run by shirley holmesyou know, the woman who wrote          campfire girl. camp will teach dolores haze to grow in many thingshealth, knowledge, temper. and particularly in a sense of responsibility towards other people. shall we take these candles with us and sit for a while on the piazza, or do you want to go to bed and nurse that tooth         nurse that tooth.                                             next day they drove downtown to buy things needed for the camp any wearable purchase worked wonders with lo. she seemed her usual sarcastic self at dinner. immediately afterwards, she went up to her room to plunge into the comic books acquired for rainy days at camp q they were so thoroughly sampled by thursday that she left them behind. i too retired to my lair, and wrote letters. my plan now was to leave for the seaside and then, when school began, resume my existence in the haze household for i knew already that i could not live without the child. on tuesday they went shopping again, and i was asked to answer the phone if the camp mistress rang up during their absence. she did and a month or so later we had occasion to recall our pleasant chat. that tuesday, lo had her dinner in her room. she had been crying after a routine row with her mother and, as had happened on former occasions, had not wished me to see her swollen eyes she had one of those tender complexions that after a good cry get all blurred and inflamed, and morbidly alluring. i regretted keenly her mistake about my private aesthetics, for i simply love that tinge of botticellian pink, that raw rose about the lips, those wet, matted eyelashes and, naturally, her bashful whim deprived me of many opportunities of specious consolation. there was, however, more to it than i thought. as we sat in the darkness of the verandah a rude wind had put out her red candles, haze, with a dreary laugh, said she had told lo that her beloved humbert thoroughly approved of the whole camp idea and now, added haze, the child throws a fit pretext you and i want to get rid of her actual reason i told her we would exchange tomorrow for plainer stuff some much too cute night things that she bullied me into buying for her. you see,          shesees herself as a starlet          isee her as a sturdy, healthy, but decidedly homely kid. this, i guess, is at the root of our troubles.         on wednesday i managed to waylay lo for a few seconds she was on the landing, in sweatshirt and greenstained white shorts, rummaging in a trunk. i said something meant to be friendly and funny but she only emitted a snort without looking at me. desperate, dying humbert patted her clumsily on her coccyx, and she struck him, quite painfully, with one of the late mr. hazes shoetrees. doublecrosser, she said as i crawled downstairs rubbing my arm with a great show of rue. she did not condescend to have dinner with hum and mum washed her hair and went to bed with her ridiculous books. and on thursday quiet mrs. haze drove her to camp q.         as greater authors than i have put it let readers imagine etc. on second thought, i may as well give those imaginations a kick in the pants. i knew i had fallen in love with lolita forever but i also knew she would not be forever lolita. she would be thirteen on january . in two years or so she would cease being a nymphet and would turn into a young girl, and then, into a college girlthat horror of horrors. the word forever referred only to my own passion, to the eternal lolita as reflected in my blood. the lolita whose iliac crests had not yet flared, the lolita that today i could touch and smell and hear and see, the lolita of the strident voice and rich brown hairof the bangs and the swirls and the sides and the curls at the back, and the sticky hot neck, and the vulgar vocabularyrevolting, super, luscious, goon, drip          thatlolita,          mylolita, poor catullus would lose forever. so how could i afford not to see her for two months of summer insomnias two whole months out of the two years of her remaining nymphage should i disguise myself as a somber oldfashioned girl, gawky mlle humbert, and put up my tent on the outskirts of camp q, in the hope that its russet nymphets would clamor let us adopt that deepvoiced d.p., and drag the said, shyly smiling berthe          au grand piedto their rustic hearth. berthe will sleep with dolores haze         idle dry dreams. two months of beauty, two months of tenderness, would be squandered forever, and i could do nothing about it, but nothing,          mais rien.         one drop of rare honey, however, that thursday did hold in its acorn cup. haze was to drive her to the camp in the early morning. upon sundry sounds of departure reaching me, i rolled out of bed and leaned out of the window. under the poplars, the car was already athrob. on the sidewalk, louise stood shading her eyes with her hand, as if the little traveler were already riding into the low morning sun. the gesture proved to be premature. hurry up shouted haze. my lolita, who was half in and about to slam the car door, wind down the glass, wave to louise and the poplars whom and which she was never to see again, interrupted the motion of fate she looked upand dashed back into the house haze furiously calling after her. a moment later i heard my sweetheart running up the stairs. my heart expanded with such force that it almost blotted me out. i hitched up the pants of my pajamas, flung the door open and simultaneously lolita arrived, in her sunday frock, stamping, panting, and then she was in my arms, her innocent mouth melting under the ferocious pressure of dark male jaws, my palpitating darling the next instant i heart heralive, unrapedclatter downstairs. the motion of fate was resumed. the blond leg was pulled in, the car door was slammedwas reslammedand driver haze at the violent wheel, rubberred lips writhing in angry, inaudible speech, swung my darling away, while unnoticed by them or louise, old miss opposite, an invalid, feebly but rhythmically waved from her vined verandah.                                             the hollow of my hand was still ivoryfull of lolitafull of the feel of her preadolescently incurved back, that ivorysmooth, sliding sensation of her skin through the thin frock that i had worked up and down while i held her. i marched into her tumbled room, threw open the door of the closet, and plunged into a heap of crumpled things that had touched her. there was particularly one pink texture, sleazy, torn, with a faintly acrid odor in the seam. i wrapped in it humberts huge engorged heart. a poignant chaos was welling within mebut i had to drop those things and hurriedly regain my composure, as i became aware of the maids velvety voice calling me softly from the stairs. she had a message for me, she said and, topping my automatic thanks with a kindly youre welcome, good louise left an unstamped, curiously cleanlooking letter in my shaking hand.                             this is a confession. i love you so the letter began and for a distorted moment i mistook its hysterical scrawl for a schoolgirls scribble. last sunday in churchbad you, who refused to come to see our beautiful new windowsonly last sunday, my dear one, when i asked the lord what to do about it, i was told to act as i am acting now. you see, there is no alternative. i have loved you from the minute i saw you. i am a passionate and lonely woman and you are the love of my life.           now, my dearest, dearest,            mon cher, cher monsieur, you have read this now you know. so, will you please,            at once, pack and leave. this is a landladys order. i am dismissing a lodger. i am kicking you out. go scram            departezi shall be back by dinnertime, if i do eighty both ways and dont have an accident but what would it matter, and i do not wish to find you in the house. please, please, leave at once,            now, do not even read this absurd note to the end. go. adieu.           the situation,            chri,is quite simple. of course, i know with            absolute certaintythat i am nothing to you, nothing at all to you, nothing at all. oh yes, you enjoy talking to me and kidding poor me, you have grown fond of our friendly house, of the books i like, of my lovely garden, even of los noisy waysbut i am nothing to you. right right. nothing to you whatever.            butif, after reading my confession, you decided, in your dark romantic european way, that i am attractive enough for you to take advantage of my letter and make a pass at me, then you would be a criminalworse than a kidnaper who rapes a child. you see,            chri. ifyou decided to stay,            ifi found you at home which i know i wontand thats why i am able to go on like this, the            factof your remaining would only mean one thing that you want me as much as i do you as a lifelong mate and that you are ready to link up your life with mine forever and ever and be a father to my little girl.           let me rave and ramble on for a teeny while more, my dearest, since i know this letter has been by now torn by you, and its pieces illegible in the vortex of the toilet. my dearest,            mon trs, trs cher, what a world of love i have built up for you during this miraculous june i know how reserved you are, how british. your oldworld reticence, your sense of decorum may be shocked by the boldness of an american girl you who conceal your strongest feelings must think me a shameless little idiot for throwing open my poor bruised heart like this. in years gone by, many disappointments came my way. mr. haze was a splendid person, a sterling soul, but he happened to be twenty years my senior, andwell, let us not gossip about the past. my dearest, your curiosity must be well satisfied if you have ignored my request and read this letter to the bitter end. never mind. destroy it and go. do not forget to leave the key on the desk in your room. and some scrap of address so that i could refund the twelve dollars i owe you till the end of the month. goodbye, dear one. pray for meif you ever pray.           c.h.                           what i present here is what i remember of the letter, and what i remember of the letter i remember verbatim including that awful french. it was at least twice longer. i have left out a lyrical passage which i more or less skipped at the time, concerning lolitas brother who died at  when she was , and how much i would have liked him. let me see what else can i say yes. there is just a chance that the vortex of the toilet where the letter did go is my own matteroffact contribution. she probably begged me to make a special fire to consume it.         my first movement was one of repulsion and retreat. my second was like a friends calm hand falling upon my shoulder and bidding me take my time. i did. i came out of my daze and found myself still in los room. a fullpage ad ripped out of a slick magazine was affixed to the wall above the bed, between a crooners mug and the lashes of a movie actress. it represented a darkhaired young husband with a kind of drained look in his irish eyes. he was modeling a robe by soandso and holding a bridgelike tray by soandso, with breakfast for two. the legend, by the rev. thomas morell, called him a conquering hero. the thoroughly conquered lady not shown was presumably propping herself up to receive her half of the tray. how her bedfellow was to get under the bridge without some messy mishap was not clear. lo had drawn a jocose arrow to the haggard lovers face and had put, in block letters h.h. and indeed, despite a difference of a few years, the resemblance was striking. under this was another picture, also a colored ad. a distinguished playwright was solemnly smoking a drome. he always smoked dromes. the resemblance was slight. under this was los chase bed, littered with comics. the enamel had come off the bedstead, leaving black, more or less rounded, marks on the white. having convinced myself that louise had left, i got into los bed and reread the letter.                                             gentlemen of the jury i cannot swear that certain motions pertaining to the business in handif i may coin an expressionhad not drifted across my mind before. my mind had not retained them in any logical form or in any relation to definitely recollected occasions but i cannot swearlet me repeatthat i had not toyed with them to rig up yet another expression, in my dimness of thought, in my darkness of passion. there may have been timesthere must have been times, if i know my humbertwhen i had brought up for detached inspection the idea of marrying a mature widow say, charlotte haze with not one relative left in the wide gray world, merely in order to have my way with her child lo, lola, lolita. i am even prepared to tell my tormentors that perhaps once or twice i had cast an appraisers cold eye at charlottes coral lips and bronze hair and dangerously low neckline, and had vaguely tried to fit her into a plausible daydream. this i confess under torture. imaginary torture, perhaps, but all the more horrible. i wish i might digress and tell you more of the          pavor nocturnusthat would rack me at night hideously after a chance term had struck me in the random readings of my boyhood, such as          peine forte et durewhat a genius of pain must have invented that or the dreadful, mysterious, insidious words trauma, traumatic event, and transom. but my tale is sufficiently incondite already.         after a while i destroyed the letter and went to my room, and ruminated, and rumpled my hair, and modeled my purple robe, and moaned through clenched teeth and suddenlysuddenly, gentlemen of the jury, i felt a dostoevskian grin dawning through the very grimace that twisted my lips like a distant and terrible sun. i imagined under conditions of new and perfect visibility all the casual caresses her mothers husband would be able to lavish on his lolita. i would hold her against me three times a day, every day. all my troubles would be expelled, i would be a healthy man. to hold thee lightly on a gentle knee and print on thy soft cheek a parents kiss wellread humbert         then, with all possible caution, on mental tiptoe so to speak, i conjured up charlotte as a possible mate. by god, i could make myself bring her that economically halved grapefruit, that sugarless breakfast.         humbert humbert sweating in the fierce white light, and howled at, and trodden upon by sweating policemen, is now ready to make a further statement           quel mot as he turns his conscience inside out and rips off its innermost lining. i did not plan to marry poor charlotte in order to eliminate her in some vulgar, gruesome and dangerous manner such as killing her by placing five bichlorideofmercury tablets in her preprandial sherry or anything like that but a delicately allied, pharmacopoeial thought did tinkle in my sonorous and clouded brain. why limit myself to the modest masked caress i had tried already other visions of venery presented themselves to me swaying and smiling. i saw myself administering a powerful sleeping potion to both mother and daughter so as to fondle the latter though the night with perfect impunity. the house was full of charlottes snore, while lolita hardly breathed in her sleep, as still as a painted girlchild. mother, i swear kenny never even          touchedme. you either lie, dolores haze, or it was an incubus. no, i would not go that far.         so humbert the cubus schemed and dreamedand the red sun of desire and decision the two things that create a live world rose higher and higher, while upon a succession of balconies a succession of libertines, sparkling glass in hand, toasted the bliss of past and future nights. then, figuratively speaking, i shattered the glass, and boldly imagined for i was drunk on those visions by then and underrated the gentleness of my nature how eventually i might blackmailno, that it too strong a wordmauvemail big haze into letting me consort with the little haze by gently threatening the poor doting big dove with desertion if she tried to bar me from playing with my legal stepdaughter. in a word, before such an amazing offer, before such a vastness and variety of vistas, i was as helpless as adam at the preview of early oriental history, miraged in his apple orchard.         and now take down the following important remark the artist in me has been given the upper hand over the gentleman. it is with a great effort of will that in this memoir i have managed to tune my style to the tone of the journal that i kept when mrs. haze was to me but an obstacle. that journal of mine is no more but i have considered it my artistic duty to preserve its intonations no matter how false and brutal they may seem to me now. fortunately, my story has reached a point where i can cease insulting poor charlotte for the sake of retrospective verisimilitude.         wishing to spare poor charlotte two or three hours of suspense on a winding road and avoid, perhaps, a headon collision that would shatter our different dreams, i made a thoughtful but abortive attempt to reach her at the camp by telephone. she had left half an hour before, and getting lo instead, i told hertrembling and brimming with my mastery over fatethat i was going to marry her mother. i had to repeat it twice because something was preventing her from giving me her attention. gee, thats swell, she said laughing. when is the wedding hold on a sec, the pupthat put here has got hold of my sock. listen and she added she guessed she was going to have loads of fun and i realized as i hung up that a couple of hours at that camp had been sufficient to blot out with new impressions the image of handsome humbert humbert from little lolitas mind. but what did it matter now i would get her back as soon as a decent amount of time after the wedding had elapsed. the orange blossom would have scarcely withered on the grave, as a poet might have said. but i am no poet. i am only a very conscientious recorder.         after louise had gone, i inspected the icebox, and finding it much too puritanic, walked to town and bought the richest foods available. i also bought some good liquor and two or three kinds of vitamins. i was pretty sure that with the aid of these stimulants and my natural resources, i would avert any embarrassment that my indifference might incur when called upon to display a strong and impatient flame. again and again resourceful humbert evoked charlotte as seen in the rareeshow of a manly imagination. she was well groomed and shapely, this i could say for her, and she was my lolitas big sisterthis notion, perhaps, i could keep up if only i did not visualize too realistically her heavy hips, round knees, ripe bust, the coarse pink skin of her neck coarse by comparison with silk and honey and all the rest of that sorry and dull thing a handsome woman.         the sun made its usual round of the house as the afternoon ripened into evening. i had a drink. and another. and yet another. gin and pineapple juice, my favorite mixture, always double my energy. i decided to busy myself with our unkempt lawn.          une petite attention.it was crowded with dandelions, and a cursed dogi loathe dogshad defiled the flat stones where a sundial had once stood. most of the dandelions had changed from suns to moons. the gin and lolita were dancing in me, and i almost fell over the folding chairs that i attempted to dislodge. incarnadine zebras there are some eructations that sound like cheersat least, mine did. an old fence at the back of the garden separated us from the neighbors garbage receptacles and lilacs but there was nothing between the front end of our lawn where it sloped along one side of the house and the street. therefore i was able to watch with the smirk of one about to perform a good action for the return of charlotte that tooth should be extracted at once. as i lurched and lunged with the hand mower, bits of grass optically twittering in the low sun, i kept an eye on that section of suburban street. it curved in from under an archway of huge shade trees, then sped towards us down, down, quite sharply, past old miss opposites ivied brick house and highsloping lawn much trimmer than ours and disappeared behind our own front porch which i could not see from where i happily belched and labored. the dandelions perished. a reek of sap mingled with the pineapple. two little girls, marion and mabel, whose comings and goings i had mechanically followed of late but who could replace my lolita went toward the avenue from which our lawn street cascaded, one pushing a bicycle, the other feeding from a paper bag, both talking at the top of their sunny voices. leslie, old miss opposites gardener and chauffeur, a very amiable and athletic negro, grinned at me from afar and shouted, reshouted, commented by gesture, that i was mighty energetic today. the fool dog of the prosperous junk dealer next door ran after a blue carnot charlottes. the prettier of the two little girls mabel, i think, shorts, halter with little to halt, bright haira nymphet, by panran back down the street crumpling her paper bag and was hidden from this green goat by the frontage of mr. and mrs. humberts residence. a station wagon popped out of the leafy shade of the avenue, dragging some of it on its roof before the shadows snapped, and swung by at an idiotic pace, the sweatshirted driver roofholding with his left hand and the junkmans dog tearing alongside. there was a smiling pauseand then, with a flutter in my breast, i witnessed the return of the blue sedan. i saw it glide downhill and disappear behind the corner of the house. i had a glimpse of her calm pale profile. it occurred to me that until she went upstairs she would not know whether i had gone or not. a minute later, with an expression of great anguish on her face, she looked down at me from the window of los room. by sprinting upstairs, i managed to reach that room before she left it.                                             when the bride is a window and the groom is a widower when the former has lived in our great little town for hardly two years, and the latter for hardly a month when monsieur wants to get the whole damned thing over with as quickly as possible, and madame gives in with a tolerant smile then, my reader, the wedding is generally a quiet affair. the bride may dispense with a tiara of orange blossoms securing her fingertip veil, nor does she carry a white orchid in a prayer book. the brides little daughter might have added to the ceremonies uniting h. and h. a touch of vivid vermeil but i knew i would not dare be too tender with cornered lolita yet, and therefore agreed it was not worth while tearing the child away from her beloved camp q.         my          soidisantpassionate and lonely charlotte was in everyday life matteroffact and gregarious. moreover, i discovered that although she could not control her heart or her cries, she was a woman of principle. immediately after she had become more or less my mistress despite the stimulants, her nervous, eager          chria heroic          chri         had some initial trouble, for which, however, he amply compensated her by a fantastic display of oldworld endearments, good charlotte interviewed me about my relations with god. i could have answered that on that score my mind was open i said, insteadpaying my tribute to a pious platitudethat i believed in a cosmic spirit. looking down at her fingernails, she also asked me had i not in my family a certain strange strain. i countered by inquiring whether she would still want to marry me if my fathers maternal grandfather had been, say, a turk. she said it did not matter a bit but that, if she ever found out i did not believe in our christian god, she would commit suicide. she said it so solemnly that it gave me the creeps. it was then i knew she was a woman of principle.         oh, she was very genteel she said excuse me whenever a slight burp interrupted her flowing speech, called an envelope and ahnvelope, and when talking to her ladyfriends referred to me as mr. humbert. i thought it would please her if i entered the community trailing some glamour after me. on the day of our wedding a little interview with me appeared in the society column of the ramsdale          journal, with a photograph of charlotte, one eyebrow up and a misprint in her name hazer. despite this contretempts, the publicity warmed the porcelain cockles of her heartand made my rattles shake with awful glee. by engaging in church work as well as by getting to know the better mothers of los schoolmates, charlotte in the course of twenty months or so had managed to become if not a prominent, at least an acceptable citizen, but never before had she come under that thrilling          rubrique, and it was i who put her there, mr. edgar h. humbert i threw in the edgar just for the heck of it, writer and explorer. mccoos brother, when taking it down, asked me what i had written. whatever i told him came out as several books on peacock, rainbow and other poets. it was also noted that charlotte and i had known each other for several years and that i was a distant relation of her first husband. i hinted i had had an affair with her thirteen years ago but this was not mentioned in print. to charlotte i said that society columns          shouldcontain a shimmer of errors.         let us go on with this curious tale. when called upon to enjoy my promotion from lodger to lover, did i experience only bitterness and distaste no. mr. humbert confesses to a certain titillation of his vanity, to some faint tenderness, even to a pattern of remorse daintily running along the steel of his conspiratorial dagger. never had i thought that the rather ridiculous, through rather handsome mrs. haze, with her blind faith in the wisdom of her church and book club, her mannerisms of elocution, her harsh, cold, contemptuous attitude toward an adorable, downyarmed child of twelve, could turn into such a touching, helpless creature as soon as i laid my hands upon her which happened on the threshold of lolitas room whither she tremulously backed repeating no, no, please no.         the transformation improved her looks. her smile that had been such a contrived thing, thenceforth became the radiance of utter adorationa radiance having something soft and moist about it, in which, with wonder, i recognized a resemblance to the lovely, inane, lost look that lo had when gloating over a new kind of concoction at the soda fountain or mutely admiring my expensive, always tailorfresh clothes. deeply fascinated, i would watch charlotte while she swapped parental woes with some other lady and made that national grimace of feminine resignation eyes rolling up, mouth drooping sideways which, in an infantile form, i had seen lo making herself. we had highballs before turning in, and with their help, i would manage to evoke the child while caressing the mother. this was the white stomach within which my nymphet had been a little curved fish in . this carefully dyed hair, so sterile to my sense of smell and touch, acquired at certain lamplit moments in the poster bed the tinge, if not the texture, of lolitas curls. i kept telling myself, as i wielded my brandnew largeaslife wife, that biologically this was the nearest i could get to lolita that at lolitas age, lotte had been as desirable a schoolgirl as her daughter was, and as lolitas daughter would be some day. i had my wife unearth from under a collection of shoes mr. haze had a passion for them, it appears a thirtyyearold album, so that i might see how lotte had looked as a child and even though the light was wrong and the dresses graceless, i was able to make out a dim first version of lolitas outline, legs, cheekbones, bobbed nose. lottelita, lolitchen.         so i tompeeped across the hedges of years, into wan little windows. and when, by means of pitifully ardent, naively lascivious caresses, she of the noble nipple and massive thigh prepared me for the performance of my nightly duty, it was still a nymphets scent that in despair i tried to pick up, as i bayed through the undergrowth of dark decaying forests.         i simply cant tell you how gentle, how touching my poor wife was. at breakfast, in the depressingly bright kitchen, with its chrome glitter and hardware and co. calendar and cute breakfast nook simulating that coffee shoppe where in their college days charlotte and humbert used to coo together, she would sit, robed in red, her elbow on the plastictopped table, her cheek propped on her fist, and stare at me with intolerable tenderness as i consumed my ham and eggs. humberts face might twitch with neuralgia, but in her eyes it vied in beauty and animation with the sun and shadows of leaves rippling on the white refrigerator. my solemn exasperation was to her the silence of love. my small income added to her even smaller one impressed her as a brilliant fortune not because the resulting sum now sufficed for most middleclass needs, but because even my money shone in her eyes with the magic of my manliness, and she saw our joint account as one of those southern boulevards at midday that have solid shade on one side and smooth sunshine on the other, all the way to the end of a prospect, where pink mountains loom.         into the fifty days of our cohabitation charlotte crammed the activities of as many years. the poor woman busied herself with a number of things she had foregone long before or had never been much interested in, as if to prolong these proustian intonations by my marrying the mother of the child i loved i had enabled my wife to regain an abundance of youth by proxy. with the zest of a banal young bride, she started to glorify the home. knowing as i did its every cranny by heartsince those days when from my chair i mentally mapped out lolitas course through the housei had long entered into a sort of emotional relationship with it, with its very ugliness and dirt, and now i could almost feel the wretched thing cower in its reluctance to endure the bath of ecru and ocher and puttbuffandsnuff that charlotte planned to give it. she never got as far as that, thank god, but she did use up a tremendous amount of energy in washing window shades, waxing the slats of venetian blinds, purchasing new shades and new blinds, returning them to the store, replacing them by others, and so on, in a constant chiaroscuro of smiles and frowns, doubts and pouts. she dabbled in cretonnes and chintzes she changed the colors of the sofathe sacred sofa where a bubble of paradise had once burst in slow motion within me. she rearranged the furnitureand was pleased when she found, in a household treatise, that it is permissible to separate a pair of sofa commodes and their companion lamps. with the authoress of          your home is you, she developed a hatred for little lean chairs and spindle tables. she believed that a room having a generous expanse of glass, and lots of rich wood paneling was an example of the masculine type of room, whereas the feminine type was characterized by lighterlooking windows and frailer woodwork. the novels i had found her reading when i moved in were now replaced by illustrated catalogues and homemaking guides. from a firm located at  roosevelt blvd., philadelphia, she ordered for our double bed a damask covered  coil mattressalthough the old one seemed to me resilient and durable enough for whatever it had to support.         a midwesterner, as her late husband had also been, she had lived in coy ramsdale, the gem of an eastern state, not long enough to know all the nice people. she knew slightly the jovial dentist who lived in a kind of ramshackle wooden chateau behind our lawn. she had met at a church tea the snooty wife of the local junk dealer who owned the colonial white horror at the corner of the avenue. now and then she visited with old miss opposite but the more patrician matrons among those she called upon, or met at lawn functions, or had telephone chats withsuch dainty ladies as mrs. glave, mrs. sheridan, mrs. mccrystal, mrs. knight and others, seldom seemed to call on my neglected charlotte. indeed, the only couple with whom she had relations of real cordiality, devoid of any          arrirepenseor practical foresight, were the farlows who had just come back from a business trip to chile in time to attend our wedding, with the chatfields, mccoos, and a few others but not mrs. junk or the even prouder mrs. talbot. john farlow was a middleaged, quiet, quietly athletic, quietly successful dealer in sporting goods, who had an office at parkington, forty miles away it was he who got me the cartridges for that colt and showed me how to use it, during a walk in the woods one sunday he was also what he called with a smile a parttime lawyer and had handled some of charlottes affairs. jean, his youngish wife and first cousin, was a longlimbed girl in harlequin glasses with two boxer dogs, two pointed breasts and a big red mouth. she paintedlandscapes and portraitsand vividly do i remember praising, over cocktails, the picture she had made of a niece of hers, little rosaline honeck, a rosy honey in a girl scout uniform, beret of green worsted, belt of green webbing, charming shoulderlong curlsand john removed his pipe and said it was a pity dolly my dolita and rosaline were so critical of each other at school, but he hoped, and we all hoped, they would get on better when they returned from their respective camps. we talked of the school. it had its drawbacks, and it had its virtues. of course, too many of the tradespeople here are italians, said john, but on the other hand we are still spared i wish, interrupted jean with a laugh, dolly and rosaline were spending the summer together. suddenly i imagined lo returning from campbrown, warm, drowsy, druggedand was ready to weep with passion and impatience.                                             a few words more about mrs. humbert while the going is good a bad accident is to happen quite soon. i had been always aware of the possessive streak in her, but i never thought she would be so crazily jealous of anything in my life that had not been she. she showed a fierce insatiable curiosity for my past. she desired me to resuscitate all my loves so that she might make me insult them, and trample upon them, and revoke them apostately and totally, thus destroying my past. she made me tell her about my marriage to valeria, who was of course a scream but i also had to invent, or to pad atrociously, a long series of mistresses for charlottes morbid delectation. to keep her happy, i had to present her with an illustrated catalogue of them, all nicely differentiated, according to the rules of those american ads where schoolchildren are pictured in a subtle ratio of races, with oneonly one, but as cute as they make themchocolatecolored roundeyed little lad, almost in the very middle of the front row. so i presented my women, and had them smile and swaythe languorous blond, the fiery brunette, the sensual copperheadas if on parade in a bordello. the more popular and platitudinous i made them, the more mrs. humbert was pleased with the show.         never in my life had i confessed so much or received so many confessions. the sincerity and artlessness with which she discussed what she called her lovelife, from first necking to connubial catchascatchcan, were, ethically, in striking contrast with my glib compositions, but technically the two sets were congeneric since both were affected by the same stuff soap operas, psychoanalysis and cheap novelettes upon which i drew for my characters and she for her mode of expression. i was considerably amused by certain remarkable sexual habits that the good harold haze had had according to charlotte who thought my mirth improper but otherwise her autobiography was as devoid of interests as her autopsy would have been. i never saw a healthier woman than she, despite thinning diets.         of my lolita she seldom spokemore seldom, in fact, than she did of the blurred, blond male baby whose photograph to the exclusion of all others adorned our bleak bedroom. in once of her tasteless reveries, she predicted that the dead infants soul would return to earth in the form of the child she would bear in her present wedlock. and although i felt no special urge to supply the humbert line with a replica of harolds production lolita, with an incestuous thrill, i had grown to regard as          mychild, it occurred to me that a prolonged confinement, with a nice cesarean operation and other complications in a safe maternity ward sometime next spring, would give me a chance to be alone with my lolita for weeks, perhapsand gorge the limp nymphet with sleeping pills.         oh, she simply hated her daughter what i thought especially vicious was that she had gone out of her way to answer with great diligence the questionnaires in a fools book she had           a guide to your childs development, published in chicago. the rigmarole went year by year, and mom was supposed to fill out a kind of inventory at each of her childs birthdays. on los twelfth, january , , charlotte haze, ne becker, had underlined the following epithets, ten out of forty, under your childs personality aggressive, boisterous, critical, distrustful, impatient, irritable, inquisitive, listless, negativistic underlined twice and obstinate. she had ignored the thirty remaining adjectives, among which were cheerful, cooperative, energetic, and so forth. it was really maddening. with a brutality that otherwise never appeared in my loving wifes mild nature, she attacked and routed such of los little belongings that had wandered to various parts of the house to freeze there like so many hypnotized bunnies. little did the good lady dream that one morning when an upset stomach the result of my trying to improve on her sauces had prevented me from accompanying her to church, i deceived her with one of lolitas anklets. and then, her attitude toward my saporous darlings letters         dear mummy and hummy,         hope you are fine. thank you very much for the candy. i crossed out and rewritten again i lost my new sweater in the woods. it has been cold here for the last few days. im having a time. love,         dolly.         the dumb child, said mrs. humbert, has left out a word before time. that sweater was allwool, and i wish you would not send her candy without consulting me.                                             there was a woodlake hourglass lakenot as i had thought it was spelled a few miles from ramsdale, and there was one week of great heat at the end of july when we drove there daily. i am now obliged to describe in some tedious detail our last swim there together, one tropical tuesday morning.         we had left the car in a parking area not far from the road and were making our way down a path cut through the pine forest to the lake, when charlotte remarked that jean farlow, in quest of rare light effects jean belonged to the old school of painting, had seen leslie taking a dip in the ebony as john had quipped at five oclock in the morning last sunday.         the water, i said, must have been quite cold.         that is not the point, said the logical doomed dear. he is subnormal, you see. and, she continued in that carefully phrased way of hers that was beginning to tell on my health, i have a very definite feeling our louise is in love with that moron.         feeling. we feel dolly is not doing as well etc. from an old school report.         the humberts walked on, sandaled and robed.         do you know, hum i have one most ambitious dream, pronounced lady hum, lowering her headshy of that dreamand communing with the tawny ground. i would love to get hold of a real trained servant maid like that german girl the talbots spoke of and have her live in the house.         no room, i said.         come, she said with her quizzical smile, surely,          chri,you underestimate the possibilities of the humbert home. we would put her in los room. i intended to make a guestroom of that hole anyway. its the coldest and meanest in the whole house.         what are you talking about i asked, the skin of my cheekbones tensing up this i take the trouble to note only because my daughters skin did the same when she felt that way disbelief, disgust, irritation.         are you bothered by romantic associations queried my wifein allusion to her first surrender.         hell no, said i. i just wonder where will you put your daughter when you get your guest or your maid.         ah, said mrs. humbert, dreaming, smiling, drawing out the ah simultaneously with the raise of one eyebrow and a soft exhalation of breath. little lo, im afraid, does not enter the picture at all, at all. little lo goes straight from camp to a good boarding school with strict discipline and some sound religious training. and thenbeardsley college. i have it all mapped out, you need not worry.         she went on to say that she, mrs. humbert, would have to overcome her habitual sloth and write to miss phallis sister who taught at st. algebra. the dazzling lake emerged. i said i had forgotten my sunglasses in the car and would catch up with her.         i had always thought that wringing ones hands was a fictional gesturethe obscure outcome, perhaps, of some medieval ritual but as i took to the woods, for a spell of despair and desperate meditation, this was the gesture look, lord, at these chains that would have come nearest to the mute expression of my mood.         had charlotte been valeria, i would have known how to handle the situation and handle is the word i want. in the good old days, by merely twisting fat valechkas brittle wrist the one she had fallen upon from a bicycle i could make her change her mind instantly but anything of the sort in regard to charlotte was unthinkable. bland american charlotte frightened me. my lighthearted dream of controlling her through her passion for me was all wrong. i dared not do anything to spoil the image of me she had set up to adore. i had toadied to her when she was the awesome duenna of my darling, and a groveling something still persisted in my attitude toward her. the only ace i held was her ignorance of my monstrous love for her lo. she had been annoyed by los liking me but          myfeelings she could not divine. to valeria i might have said look here, you fat fool,          cest moi qui dcidewhat is good for dolores humbert. to charlotte, i could not even say with ingratiating calm excuse me, my dear, i disagree. let us give the child one more chance. let me be her private tutor for a year or so. you once told me yourself in fact, i could not say anything at all to charlotte about the child without giving myself away. oh, you cannot imagine as i had never imagined what these women of principle are charlotte, who did not notice the falsity of all the everyday conventions and rules of behavior, and foods, and books, and people she doted upon, would distinguish at once a false intonation in anything i might say with a view to keeping lo near. she was like a musician who may be an odious vulgarian in ordinary life, devoid of tact and taste but who will hear a false note in music with diabolical accuracy of judgment. to break charlottes will, i would have to break her heart. if i broke her heart, her image of me would break too. if i said either i have my way with lolita, and you help me to keep the matter quiet, or we part at once, she would have turned as pale as a woman of clouded glass and slowly replied all right, whatever you add or retract, this is the end. and the end it would be.         such, then, was the mess. i remember reaching the parking area and pumping a handful of rusttasting water, and drinking it as avidly as if it would give me magic wisdom, youth, freedom, a tiny concubine. for a while, purplerobed, heeldangling, i sat on the edge of one of the rude tables, under the whooshing pines. in the middle distance, two little maidens in shorts and halters came out of a sundappled privy marked women. gumchewing mabel or mabels understudy laboriously, absentmindedly straddled a bicycle, and marion, shaking her hair because of the flies, settled behind, legs wide apart and wobbling, they slowly, absently, merged with the light and shade. lolita father and daughter melting into these woods the natural solution was to destroy mrs. humbert. but how         no man can bring about the perfect murder chance, however, can do it. there was the famous dispatch of a mme lacour in arles, southern france, at the close of last century. an unidentified bearded sixfooter, who, it was later conjectured, had been the ladys secret lover, walked up to her in a crowded street, soon after her marriage to colonel lacour, and mortally stabbed her in the back, three times, while the colonel, a small bulldog of a man, hung onto the murderers arm. by a miraculous and beautiful coincidence, right at the moment when the operator was in the act of loosening the angry little husbands jaws while several onlookers were closing in upon the group, a cranky italian in the house nearest to the scene set off by sheer accident some kind of explosive he was tinkering with, and immediately the street was turned into a pandemonium of smoke, falling bricks and running people. the explosion hurt no one except that it knocked out game colonel lacour but the ladys vengeful lover ran when the others ranand lived happily ever after.         now look what happens when the operator himself plans a perfect removal.         i walked down to hourglass lake. the spot from which we and a few other nice couples the farlows, the chatfields bathed was a kind of small cove my charlotte liked it because it was almost a private beach. the main bathing facilities or drowning facilities as the ramsdale          journalhad had occasion to say were in the left eastern part of the hourglass, and could not be seen from our covelet. to our right, the pines soon gave way to a curve of marshland which turned again into forest on the opposite side.         i sat down beside my wife so noiselessly that she started.         shall we go in she asked.         we shall in a minute. let me follow a train of thought.         i thought. more than a minute passed.         all right. come on.         was i on that train         you certainly were.         i hope so, said charlotte entering the water. it soon reached the gooseflesh of her thick thighs and then, joining her outstretched hands, shutting her mouth tight, very plainfaced in her black rubber headgear, charlotte flung herself forward with a great splash.         slowly we swam out into the shimmer of the lake.         on the opposite bank, at least a thousand paces away if one cold walk across water, i could make out the tiny figures of two men working like beavers on their stretch of shore. i knew exactly who they were a retired policeman of polish descent and the retired plumber who owned most of the timber on that side of the lake. and i also knew they were engaged in building, just for the dismal fun of the thing, a wharf. the knocks that reached us seemed so much bigger than what could be distinguished of those dwarfs arms and tools indeed, one suspected the director of those acrosonic effects to have been at odds with the puppetmaster, especially since the hefty crack of each diminutive blow lagged behind its visual version.         the short whitesand strip of our beachfrom which by now we had gone a little way to reach deep waterwas empty on weekday mornings. there was nobody around except those two tiny very busy figures on the opposite side, and a darkred private plane that droned overhead, and then disappeared in the blue. the setting was really perfect for a brisk bubbling murder, and here was the subtle point the man of law and the man of water were just near enough to witness an accident and just far enough not to observe a crime. they were near enough to hear a distracted bather thrashing about and bellowing for somebody to come and help him save his drowning wife and they were too far to distinguish if they happened to look too soon that the anything but distracted swimmer was finishing to tread his wife underfoot. i was not yet at that stage i merely want to convey the ease of the act, the nicety of the setting so there was charlotte swimming on with dutiful awkwardness she was a very mediocre mermaid, but not without a certain solemn pleasure for was not her merman by her side and as i watched, with the stark lucidity of a future recollection you knowtrying to see things as you will remember having seen them, the glossy whiteness of her wet face so little tanned despite all her endeavors, and her pale lips, and her naked convex forehead, and the tight black cap, and the plump wet neck, i knew that all i had to do was to drop back, take a deep breath, then grab her by the ankle and rapidly dive with my captive corpse. i say corpse because surprise, panic and inexperience would cause her to inhale at once a lethal gallon of lake, while i would be able to hold on for at least a full minute, openeyed under water. the fatal gesture passed like the tail of a falling star across the blackness of the contemplated crime. it was like some dreadful silent ballet, the male dancer holding the ballerina by her foot and streaking down through watery twilight. i might come up for a mouthful of air while still holding her down, and then would dive again as many times as would be necessary, and only when the curtain came down on her for good, would i permit myself to yell for help. and when some twenty minutes later the two puppets steadily growing arrived in a rowboat, one half newly painted, poor mrs. humbert humbert, the victim of a cramp or coronary occlusion, or both, would be standing on her head in the inky ooze, some thirty feet below the smiling surface of hourglass lake.         simple, was it not but what dye know, folksi just could not make myself do it         she swam beside me, a trustful and clumsy seal, and all the logic of passion screamed in my ear now is the time and, folks, i just couldnt in silence i turned shoreward and gravely, dutifully, she also turned, and still hell screamed its counsel, and still i could not make myself drown the poor, slippery, bigbodied creature. the scream grew more and more remote as i realized the melancholy fact that neither tomorrow, nor friday, nor any other day or night, could i make myself put her to death. oh, i could visualize myself slapping valerias breasts out of alignment, or otherwise hurting herand i could see myself, no less clearly, shooting her lover in the underbelly and making him say akh and sit down. but i could not kill charlotteespecially when things were on the whole not quite as hopeless, perhaps, as they seemed at first wince on that miserable morning. were i to catch her by her strong kicking foot were i to see her amazed look, hear her awful voice were i still to go through with the ordeal, her ghost would haunt me all my life. perhaps if the year were  instead of  i might have hoodwinked my gentle nature by administering her some classical poison from a hollow agate, some tender philter of death. but in our middleclass nosy era it would not have come off the way it used to in the brocaded palaces of the past. nowadays you have to be a scientist if you want to be a killer. no, no, i was neither. ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the majority of sex offenders that hanker for some throbbing, sweetmoaning, physical but not necessarily coital, relation with a girlchild, are innocuous, inadequate, passive, timid strangers who merely ask the community to allow them to pursue their practically harmless, socalled aberrant behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them. we are not sex fiends we do not rape as good soldiers do. we are unhappy, mild, dogeyed gentlemen, sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults, but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet. emphatically, no killers are we. poets never kill. oh, my poor charlotte, do not hate me in your eternal heaven among an eternal alchemy of asphalt and rubber and metal and stonebut thank god, not water, not water         nonetheless it was a very close shave, speaking quite objectively. and now comes the point of my perfectcrime parable.         we sat down on our towels in the thirsty sun. she looked around, loosened her bra, and turned over on her stomach to give her back a chance to be feasted upon. she said she loved me. she sighed deeply. she extended one arm and groped in the pocket of her robe for her cigarettes. she sat up and smoked. she examined her right shoulder. she kissed me heavily with open smoky mouth. suddenly, down the sand bank behind us, from under the bushes and pines, a stone rolled, then another.         those disgusting prying kids, said charlotte, holding up her big bra to her breast and turning prone again. i shall have to speak about that to peter krestovski.         from the debouchment of the trail came a rustle, a footfall, and jean farlow marched down with her easel and things.         you scared us, said charlotte.         jean said she had been up there, in a place of green concealment, spying on nature spies are generally shot, trying to finish a lakescape, but it was no good, she had no talent whatever which was quite trueand have          youever tried painting, humbert charlotte, who was a little jealous of jean, wanted to know if john was coming.         he was. he was coming home for lunch today. he had dropped her on the way to parkington and should be picking her up any time now. it was a grand morning. she always felt a traitor to cavall and melampus for leaving them roped on such gorgeous days. she sat down on the white sand between charlotte and me. she wore shorts. her long brown legs were about as attractive to me as those of a chestnut mare. she showed her gums when she smiled.         i almost put both of you into my lake, she said. i even noticed something you overlooked. you addressing humbert had your wrist watch on in, yes, sir, you had.         waterproof, said charlotte softly, making a fish mouth.         jean took my wrist upon her knee and examined charlottes gift, then put back humberts hand on the sand, palm up.         you could see anything that way, remarked charlotte coquettishly.         jean sighed. i once saw, she said, two children, male and female, at sunset, right here, making love. their shadows were giants. and i told you about mr. tomson at daybreak. next time i expect to see fat old ivor in the ivory. he is really a freak, that man. last time he told me a completely indecent story about his nephew. it appears         hullo there, said johns voice.                                             my habit of being silent when displeased or, more exactly, the cold and scaly quality of my displeased silence, used to frighten valeria out of her wits. she used to whimper and wail, saying           ce qui me rend folle, cest que je ne sais quoi tu penses quand tu es comme a. i tried being silent with charlotteand she just chirped on, or chucked my silence under the chin. an astonishing woman i would retire to my former room, now a regular studio, mumbling i had after all a learned opus to write, and cheerfully charlotte went on beautifying the home, warbling on the telephone and writing letters. from my window, through the lacquered shiver of poplar leaves, i could see her crossing the street and contentedly mailing her letter to miss phalens sister.         the week of scattered showers and shadows which elapsed after our last visit to the motionless sands of hourglass lake was one of the gloomiest i can recall. then came two or three dim rays of hopebefore the ultimate sunburst.         it occurred to me that i had a fine brain in beautiful working order and that i might as well use it. if i dared not meddle with my wifes plans for her daughter getting warmer and browner every day in the fair weather of hopeless distance, i could surely devise some general means to assert myself in a general way that might be later directed toward a particular occasion. one evening, charlotte herself provided me with an opening.         i have a surprise for you, she said looking at me with fond eyes over a spoonful of soup. in the fall we two are going to england.         i swallowed          myspoonful, wiped my lips with pink paper oh, the cool rich linens of mirana hotel and said         i have also a surprise for you, my dear. we two are not going to england.         why, whats the matter she said, lookingwith more surprise than i had counted uponat my hands i was involuntarily folding and tearing and crushing and tearing again the innocent pink napkin. my smiling face set her somewhat at ease, however.         the matter is quite simple, i replied. even in the most harmonious of households, as ours is, not all decisions are taken by the female partner. there are certain things that the husband is there to decide. i can well imagine the thrill that you, a healthy american gal, must experience at crossing the atlantic on the same ocean liner with lady bumbleor sam bumble, the frozen meat king, or a hollywood harlot. and i doubt not that you and i would make a pretty ad for the traveling agency when portrayed lookingyou, frankly starryeyed, i, controlling my envious admirationat the palace sentries, or scarlet guards, or beaver eaters, or whatever they are called. but i happen to be allergic to europe, including merry old england. as you well know, i have nothing but very sad associations with the old and rotting world. no colored ads in your magazines will change the situation.         my darling, said charlotte. i really         no, wait a minute. the present matter is only incidental. i am concerned with a general trend. when you wanted me to spend my afternoons sunbathing on the lake instead of doing my work, i gladly gave in and became a bronzed glamour boy for your sake, instead of remaining a scholar and, well, an educator. when you lead me to bridge and bourbon with the charming farlows, i meekly follow. no, please, wait. when you decorate your home, i do not interfere with your schemes. when you decidewhen you decide all kinds of matters, i may be in complete, or in partial, let us say, disagreementbut i say nothing. i ignore the particular. i cannot ignore the general. i love being bossed by you, but every game has its rules. i am not cross. i am not cross at all. dont do that. but i am one half of this household, and have a small but distinct voice.         she had come to my side and had fallen on her knees and was slowly, but very vehemently, shaking her head and clawing at my trousers. she said she had never realized. she said i was her ruler and her god. she said louise had gone, and let us make love right away. she said i must forgive her or she would die.         this little incident filled me with considerable elation. i told her quietly that it was a matter not of asking forgiveness, but of changing ones ways and i resolved to press my advantage and spend a good deal of time, aloof and moody, working at my bookor at least pretending to work.         the studio bed in my former room had long been converted into the sofa it had always been at heart, and charlotte had warned me since the very beginning of our cohabitation that gradually the room would be turned into a regular writers den. a couple of days after the british incident, i was sitting in a new and very comfortable easy chair, with a large volume in my lap, when charlotte rapped with her ring finger and sauntered in. how different were her movements from those of my lolita, when          sheused to visit me in her dear dirty blue jeans, smelling of orchards in nymphetland awkward and fey, and dimly depraved, the lower buttons of her shirt unfastened. let me tell you, however, something. behind the brashness of little haze, and the poise of big haze, a trickle of shy life ran that tasted the same, that murmured the same. a great french doctor once told my father that in near relatives the faintest gastric gurgle has the same voice.         so charlotte sauntered in. she felt all was not well between us. i had pretended to fall asleep the night before, and the night before that, as soon as we had gone to bed, and had risen at dawn.         tenderly, she inquired if she were not interrupting.         not at the moment, i said, turning volume c of the          girls encyclopediaaround to examine a picture printed bottomedge as printers say.         charlotte went up to a little table of imitation mahogany with a drawer. she put her hand upon it. the little table was ugly, no doubt, but it had done nothing to her.         i have always wanted to ask you, she said businesslike, not coquettish, why is this thing locked up do you want it in this room its so abominably uncouth.         leave it alone, i said. i was camping in scandinavia.         is there a key         hidden.         oh, hum         locked up love letters.         she gave me one of those woundeddoe looks that irritated me so much, and then, not quite knowing if i was serious, or how to keep up the conversation, stood for several slow pages campus, canada, candid camera, candy peering at the window pane rather than through it, drumming upon it with sharp almondandrose fingernails.         presently at canoeing or canvasback she strolled up to my chair and sank down, tweedily, weightily, on its arm, inundating me with the perfume my first wife had used. would his lordship like to spend the fall          here she asked, pointing with her little finger at an autumn view in a conservative eastern state. why very distinctly and slowly. she shrugged. probably harold used to take a vacation at that time. open season. conditional reflex on her part.         i think i know where that is, she said, still pointing. there is a hotel i remember, enchanted hunters, quaint, isnt it and the food is a dream. and nobody bothers anybody.         she rubbed her cheek against my temple. valeria soon got over that.         is there anything special you would like for dinner, dear john and jean will drop in later.         i answered with a grunt. she kissed me on my underlip, and, brightly saying she would bake a cake a tradition subsisted from my lodging days that i adored her cakes, left me to my idleness.         carefully putting down the open book where she had sat it attempted to send forth a rotation of waves, but an inserted pencil stopped the pages, i checked the hiding place of the key rather selfconsciously it lay under the old expensive safety razor i had used before she bought me a much better and cheaper one. was it the perfect hiding placethere, under the razor, in the groove of its velvetlined case the case lay in a small trunk where i kept various business papers. could i improve upon this remarkable how difficult it is to conceal thingsespecially when ones wife keeps monkeying with the furniture.                                             i think it was exactly a week after our last swim that the noon mail brought a reply from the second miss phalen. the lady wrote she had just returned to st. algebra from her sisters funeral. euphemia had never been the same after breaking that hip. as to the matter of mrs. humberts daughter, she wished to report that it was too late to enroll her this year but that she, the surviving phalen, was practically certain that if mr. and mrs. humbert brought dolores over in january, her admittance might be arranged.         next day, after lunch, i went to see our doctor, a friendly fellow whose perfect bedside manner and complete reliance on a few patented drugs adequately masked his ignorance of, and indifference to, medical science. the fact that lo would have to come back to ramsdale was a treasure of anticipation. for this event i wanted to be fully prepared. i had in fact begun my campaign earlier, before charlotte made that cruel decision of hers. i had to be sure when my lovely child arrived, that very night, and then night after night, until st. algebra took her away from me, i would possess the means of putting two creatures to sleep so thoroughly that neither sound nor touch should rouse them. throughout most of july i had been experimenting with various sleeping powders, trying them out on charlotte, a great taker of pills. the last dose i had given her she thought it was a tablet of mild bromidesto anoint her nerves had knocked her out for four solid hours. i had put the radio at full blast. i had blazed in her face an olisboslike flashlight. i had pushed her, pinched her, prodded herand nothing had disturbed the rhythm of her calm and powerful breathing. however, when i had done such a simple thing as kiss her, she had awakened at once, as fresh and strong as an octopus i barely escaped. this would not do, i thought had to get something still safer. at first, dr. byron did not seem to believe me when i said his last prescription was no match for my insomnia. he suggested i try again, and for a moment diverted my attention by showing me photographs of his family. he had a fascinating child of dollys age but i saw through his tricks and insisted he prescribe the mightiest pill extant. he suggested i play golf, but finally agreed to give me something that, he said, would really work and going to a cabinet, he produced a vial of violetblue capsules banded with dark purple at one end, which, he said, had just been placed on the market and were intended not for neurotics whom a draft of water could calm if properly administered, but only for great sleepless artists who had to die for a few hours in order to live for centuries. i love to fool doctors, and though inwardly rejoicing, pocketed the pills with a skeptical shrug. incidentally, i had had to be careful with him. once, in another connection, a stupid lapse on my part made me mention my last sanatorium, and i thought i saw the tips of his ears twitch. being not at all keen for charlotte or anybody else to know that period of my past, i had hastily explained that i had once done some research among the insane for a novel. but no matter the old rogue certainly had a sweet girleen.         i left in great spirits. steering my wifes car with one finger, i contentedly rolled homeward. ramsdale had, after all, lots of charm. the cicadas whirred the avenue had been freshly watered. smoothly, almost silkily, i turned down into our steep little street. everything was somehow so right that day. so blue and green. i knew the sun shone because my ignition key was reflected in the windshield and i knew it was exactly half past three because the nurse who came to massage miss opposite every afternoon was tripping down the narrow sidewalk in her white stockings and shoes. as usual, junks hysterical setter attacked me as i rolled downhill, and as usual, the local paper was lying on the porch where it had just been hurled by kenny.         the day before i had ended the regime of aloofness i had imposed upon myself, and now uttered a cheerful homecoming call as i opened the door of the living room. with her reamwhite nape and bronze bun to me, wearing the yellow blouse and maroon slacks she had on when i first met her, charlotte sat at the corner bureau writing a letter. my hand still on the doorknob, i repeated my hearty cry. her writing hand stopped. she sat still for a moment then she slowly turned in her chair and rested her elbow on its curved back. her face, disfigured by her emotion, was not a pretty sight as she stared at my legs and said         the haze woman, the big bitch, the old cat, the obnoxious mamma, thethe old stupid haze is no longer your dupe. she hasshe has         my fair accuser stopped, swallowing her venom and her tears. whatever humbert humbert saidor attempted to sayis inessential. she went on         youre a monster. youre a detestable, abominable, criminal fraud. if you come nearill scream out the window. get back         again, whatever h.h. murmured may be omitted, i think.         i am leaving tonight. this is all yours. only youll never, never see that miserable brat again. get out of this room.         reader, i did. i went up to the exsemistudio. arms akimbo, i stood for a moment quite still and selfcomposed, surveying from the threshold the raped little table with its open drawer, a key hanging from the lock, four other household keys on the table top. i walked across the landing into the humberts bedroom, and calmly removed my diary from under her pillow into my pocket. then i started to walk downstairs, but stopped halfway she was talking on the telephone which happened to be plugged just outside the door of the living room. i wanted to hear what she was saying she canceled an order for something or other, and returned to the parlor. i rearranged my respiration and went through the hallway to the kitchen. there, i opened a bottle of scotch. she could never resist scotch. then i walked into the dining room and from there, through the halfopen door, contemplated charlottes broad back.         you are ruining my life and yours, i said quietly. let us be civilized people. it is all your hallucination. you are crazy, charlotte. the notes you found were fragments of a novel. your name and hers were put in by mere chance. just because they came handy. think it over. i shall bring you a drink.         she neither answered nor turned, but went on writing in a scorching scrawl whatever she was writing. a third letter, presumably two in stamped envelopes were already laid out on the desk. i went back to the kitchen.         i set out two glasses to st. algebra to lo and opened the refrigerator. it roared at me viciously while i removed the ice from its heart. rewrite. let her read it again. she will not recall details. change, forge. write a fragment and show it to her or leave it lying around. why do faucets sometimes whine so horribly a horrible situation, really. the little pillowshaped blocks of icepillows for polar teddy bear, loemitted rasping, crackling, tortured sounds as the warm water loosened them in their cells. i bumped down the glasses side by side. i poured in the whiskey and a dram of soda. she had tabooed my pin. bark and bang went the icebox. carrying the glasses, i walked through the dining room and spoke through the parlor door which was a fraction ajar, not quite space enough for my elbow.         i have made you a drink, i said.         she did not answer, the mad bitch, and i placed the glasses on the sideboard near the telephone, which had started to ring.         leslie speaking. leslie tomson, said leslie tomson who favored a dip at dawn. mrs. humbert, sir, has been run over and youd better come quick.         i answered, perhaps a bit testily, that my wife was safe and sound, and still holding the receiver, i pushed open the door and said         theres this man saying youve been killed, charlotte.         but there was no charlotte in the living room.                                             i rushed out. the far side of our steep little street presented a peculiar sight. a big black glossy packard had climbed miss opposites sloping lawn at an angle from the sidewalk where a tartan laprobe had dropped in a heap, and stood there, shining in the sun, its doors open like wings, its front wheels deep in evergreen shrubbery. to the anatomical right of this car, on the trim turn of the lawnslope, an old gentleman with a white mustache, welldresseddoublebreasted gray suit, polkadotted bowtielay supine, his long legs together, like a deathsize wax figure. i have to put the impact of an instantaneous vision into a sequence of words their physical accumulation in the page impairs the actual flash, the sharp unity of impression rugheap, car, old mandoll, miss o.s nurse running with a rustle, a halfempty tumbler in her hand, back to the screened porchwhere the proppedup, imprisoned, decrepit lady herself may be imagined screeching, but not loud enough to drown the rhythmical yaps of the junk setter walking from group to groupfrom a bunch of neighbors already collected on the sidewalk, near the bit of checked stuff, and back to the car which he had finally run to earth, and then to another group on the lawn, consisting of leslie, two policemen and a sturdy man with tortoise shell glasses. at this point, i should explain that the prompt appearance of the patrolmen, hardly more than a minute after the accident, was due to their having been ticketing the illegally parked cars in a cross lane two blocks down the grade that the fellow with the glasses was frederick beale, jr., driver of the packard that his yearold father, whom the nurse had just watered on the green bank where he laya banked banker so to speakwas not in a dead faint, but was comfortably and methodically recovering from a mild heart attack or its possibility and, finally, that the laprobe on the sidewalk where she had so often pointed out to me with disapproval the crooked green cracks concealed the mangled remains of charlotte humbert who had been knocked down and dragged several feet by the beale car as she was hurrying across the street to drop three letters in the mailbox, at the corner of miss opposites lawn. these were picked up and handed to me by a pretty child in a dirty pink frock, and i got rid of them by clawing them to fragments in my trouser pocket.         three doctors and the farlows presently arrived on the scene and took over. the widower, a man of exceptional selfcontrol, neither wept nor raved. he staggered a bit, that he did but he opened his mouth only to impart such information or issue such directions as were strictly necessary in connection with the identification, examination and disposal of a dead woman, the top of her head a porridge of bone, brains, bronze hair and blood. the sun was still a blinding red when he was put to bed in dollys room by his two friends, gentle john and dewyeyed jean who, to be near, retired to the humberts bedroom for the night which, for all i know, they may not have spent as innocently as the solemnity of the occasion required.         i have no reason to dwell, in this very special memoir, on the prefuneral formalities that had to be attended to, or on the funeral itself, which was as quiet as the marriage had been. but a few incidents pertaining to those four or five days after charlottes simple death, have to be noted.         my first night of widowhood i was so drunk that i slept as soundly as the child who had slept in that bed. next morning i hastened to inspect the fragments of letters in my pocket. they had got too thoroughly mixed up to be sorted into three complete sets. i assumed that and you had better find it because i cannot buy came from a letter to lo and other fragments seemed to point to charlottes intention of fleeing with lo to parkington, or even back to pisky, lest the vulture snatch her precious lamb. other tatters and shreds never had i thought i had such strong talons obviously referred to an application not to st. a. but to another boarding school which was said to be so harsh and gray and gaunt in its methods although supplying croquet under the elms as to have earned the nickname of reformatory for young ladies. finally, the third epistle was obviously addressed to me. i made out such items as after a year of separation we may oh, my dearest, oh my worse than if it had been a woman you kept or, maybe, i shall die but on the whole my gleanings made little sense the various fragments of those three hasty missives were as jumbled in the palms of my hands as their elements had been in poor charlottes head.         that day john had to see a customer, and jean had to feed her dogs, and so i was to be deprived temporarily of my friends company. the dear people were afraid i might commit suicide if left alone, and since no other friends were available miss opposite was incommunicado, the mccoos were busy building a new house miles away, and the chatfields had been recently called to maine by some family trouble of their own, leslie and louise were commissioned to keep me company under the pretense of helping me to sort out and pack a multitude of orphaned things. in a moment of superb inspiration i showed the kind and credulous farlows we were waiting for leslie to come for his paid tryst with louise a little photograph of charlotte i had found among her affairs. from a boulder she smiled through blown hair. it had been taken in april , a memorable spring. while on a business visit to the states, i had had occasion to spend several months in pisky. we metand had a mad love affair. i was married, alas, and she was engaged to haze, but after i returned to europe, we corresponded through a friend, now dead. jean whispered she had heard some rumors and looked at the snapshot, and, still looking, handed it to john, and john removed his pipe and looked at lovely and fast charlotte becker, and handed it back to me. then they left for a few hours. happy louise was gurgling and scolding her swain in the basement.         hardly had the farlows gone than a bluechinned cleric calledand i tried to make the interview as brief as was consistent with neither hurting his feelings nor arousing his doubts. yes, i would devote all my life to the childs welfare. here, incidentally, was a little cross that charlotte becker had given me when we were both young. i had a female cousin, a respectable spinster in new york. there we would find a good private school for dolly. oh, what a crafty humbert         for the benefit of leslie and louise who might and did report it to john and jean i made a tremendously loud and beautifully enacted longdistance call and simulated a conversation with shirley holmes. when john and jean returned, i completely took them in by telling them, in a deliberately wild and confused mutter, that lo had gone with the intermediate group on a fiveday hike and could not be reached.         good lord, said jean, what shall we do         john said it was perfectly simplehe would get the climax police to find the hikersit would not take them an hour. in fact, he knew the country and         look, he continued, why don i drive there right now, and you may sleep with jeanhe did not really add that but jean supported his offer so passionately that it might be implied.         i broke down. i pleaded with john to let things remain the way they were. i said i could not bear to have the child all around me, sobbing, clinging to me, she was so highstrung, the experience might react on her future, psychiatrists have analyzed such cases. there was a sudden pause.         well, you are the doctor, said john a little bluntly. but after all i was charlottes friend and adviser. one would like to know what you are going to do about the child anyway.         john, cried jean, she is his child, not harold hazes. dont you understand humbert is dollys real father.         i see, said john. i am sorry. yes. i see. i did not realize that. it simplifies matters, of course. and whatever you feel is right.         the distraught father went on to say he would go and fetch his delicate daughter immediately after the funeral, and would do his best to give her a good time in totally different surroundings, perhaps a trip to new mexico or californiagranted, of course, he lived.         so artistically did i impersonate the calm of ultimate despair, the hush before some crazy outburst, that the perfect farlows removed me to their house. they had a good cellar, as cellars go in this country and that was helpful, for i feared insomnia and a ghost.         now i must explain          myreasons for keeping dolores away. naturally, at first, when charlotte had just been eliminated and i reentered the house a free father, and gulped down the two whiskeyandsodas i had prepared, and topped them with a pint or two of my pin, and went to the bathroom to get away from neighbors and friends, there was but one thing in my mind and pulsenamely, the awareness that a few hours hence, warm, brownhaired, and mine, mine, mine, lolita would be in my arms, shedding tears that i would kiss away faster than they could well. but as i stood wideeyed and flushed before the mirror, john farlow tenderly tapped to inquire if i was okayand i immediately realized it would be madness on my part to have her in the house with all those busybodies milling around and scheming to take her away from me. indeed, unpredictable lo herself mightwho knowsshow some foolish distrust of me, a sudden repugnance, vague fear and the likeand gone would be the magic prize at the very instant of triumph.         speaking of busybodies, i had another visitorfriend beale, the fellow who eliminated my wife. stodgy and solemn, looking like a kind of assistant executioner, with his bulldog jowls, small black eyes, thickly rimmed glasses and conspicuous nostrils, he was ushered in by john who then left us, closing the door upon us, with the utmost tact. suavely saying he had twins in my stepdaughters class, my grotesque visitor unrolled a large diagram he had made of the accident. it was, as my stepdaughter would have put it, a beaut, with all kinds of impressive arrows and dotted lines in varicolored inks. mrs. h.h.s trajectory was illustrated at several points by a series of those little outline figuresdolllike wee career girl or wacused in statistics as visual aids. very clearly and conclusively, this route came into contact with a boldly traced sinuous line representing two consecutive swervesone which the beale car made to avoid the junk dog dog not shown, and the second, a kind of exaggerated continuation of the first, meant to avert the tragedy. a very black cross indicated the spot where the trim little outline figure had at last come to rest on the sidewalk. i looked for some similar mark to denote the place on the embankment where my visitors huge wax father had reclined, but there was none. that gentleman, however, had signed the document as a witness underneath the name of leslie tomson, miss opposite and a few other people.         with his hummingbird pencil deftly and delicately flying from one point to another, frederick demonstrated his absolute innocence and the recklessness of my wife while he was in the act of avoiding the dog,          sheslipped on the freshly watered asphalt and plunged forward whereas she should have flung herself not forward but backward fred showed how by a jerk of his padded shoulder. i said it was certainly not his fault, and the inquest upheld my view.         breathing violently though jetblack tense nostrils, he shook his head and my hand then, with an air of perfect          savoir vivreand gentlemanly generosity, he offered to pay the funeralhome expenses. he expected me to refuse his offer. with a drunken sob of gratitude i accepted it. this took him aback. slowly, incredulously, he repeated what he had said. i thanked him again, even more profusely than before.         in result of that weird interview, the numbness of my soul was for a moment resolved. and no wonder i had actually seen the agent of fate. i had palpated the very flesh of fateand its padded shoulder. a brilliant and monstrous mutation had suddenly taken place, and here was the instrument. within the intricacies of the pattern hurrying housewife, slippery pavement, a pest of a dog, steep grade, big car, baboon at its wheel, i could dimly distinguish my own vile contribution. had i not been such a foolor such an intuitive geniusto preserve that journal, fluids produced by vindictive anger and hot shame would not have blinded charlotte in her dash to the mailbox. but even had they blinded her, still nothing might have happened, had not precise fate, that synchronizing phantom, mixed within its alembic the car and the dog and the sun and the shade and the wet and the weak and the strong and the stone. adieu, marlene fat fates formal handshake as reproduced by beale before leaving the room brought me out of my torpor and i wept. ladies and gentlemen of the juryi wept.                                             the elms and the poplars were turning their ruffled backs to a sudden onslaught of wind, and a black thunderhead loomed above ramsdales white church tower when i looked around me for the last time. for unknown adventures i was leaving the livid house where i had rented a room only ten weeks before. the shadesthrifty, practical bamboo shadeswere already down. on porches or in the house their rich textures lend modern drama. the house of heaven must seem pretty bare after that. a raindrop fell on my knuckles. i went back into the house for something or other while john was putting my bags into the car, and then a funny thing happened. i do not know if in these tragic notes i have sufficiently stressed the peculiar sending effect that the writers good lookspseudoceltic, attractively simian, boyishly manlyhad on women of every age and environment. of course, such announcements made in the first person may sound ridiculous. but every once in a while i have to remind the reader of my appearance much as a professional novelist, who has given a character of his some mannerism or a dog, has to go on producing that dog or that mannerism every time the character crops up in the course of the book. there may be more to it in the present case. my gloomy good looks should be kept in the minds eye if my story is to be properly understood. pubescent lo swooned to humberts charm as she did to hiccuppy music adult lotte loved me with a mature, possessive passion that i now deplore and respect more than i care to say. jean farlow, who was thirtyone and absolutely neurotic, had also apparently developed a strong liking for me. she was handsome in a carvedindian sort of way, with a burnt sienna complexion. her lips were like large crimson polyps, and when she emitted her special barking laugh, she showed large dull teeth and pale gums.         she was very tall, wore either slacks with sandals or billowing skirts with ballet slippers, drank any strong liquor in any amount, had had two miscarriages, wrote stories about animals, painted, as the reader knows, lakescapes, was already nursing the cancer that was to kill her at thirtythree, and was hopelessly unattractive to me. judge then of my alarm when a few seconds before i left she and i stood in the hallway jean, with her always trembling fingers, took me by the temples, and, tears in her bright blue eyes, attempted, unsuccessfully, to glue herself to my lips.         take care of yourself, she said, kiss your daughter for me.         a clap of thunder reverberated throughout the house, and she added         perhaps, somewhere, some day, at a less miserable time, we may see each other again jean, whatever, wherever you are, in minus timespace or plus soultime, forgive me all this, parenthesis included.         and presently i was shaking hands with both of them in the street, the sloping street, and everything was whirling and flying before the approaching white deluge, and a truck with a mattress from philadelphia was confidently rolling down to an empty house, and dust was running and writhing over the exact slab of stone where charlotte, when they lifted the laprobe for me, had been revealed, curled up, her eyes intact, their black lashes still wet, matted, like yours, lolita.                                             one might suppose that with all blocks removed and a prospect of delirious and unlimited delights before me, i would have mentally sunk back, heaving a sigh of delicious relief.          eh bine, pas du         tout         instead of basking in the beams of smiling chance, i was obsessed by all sorts of purely ethical doubts and fears. for instance might it not surprise people that lo was so consistently debarred from attending festive and funeral functions in her immediate family you rememberwe had not had her at our wedding. or another thing granted it was the long hairy arm of coincidence that had reached out to remove an innocent woman, might coincidence not ignore in a heathen moment what its twin lamb had done and hand lo a premature note of commiseration true, the accident had been reported only by the ramsdale          journalnot by the parkington          recorderor the climax          herald, camp q being in another state, and local deaths having no federal news interest but i could not help fancying that somehow dolly haze had been informed already, and that at the very time i was on my way to fetch her, she was being driven to ramsdale by friends unknown to me. still more disquieting than all these conjectures and worries, was the fact that humbert humbert, a brandnew american citizen of obscure european origin, had taken no steps toward becoming the legal guardian of his dead wifes daughter twelve years and seven months old. would i ever dare take those steps i could not repress a shiver whenever i imagined my nudity hemmed in by mysterious statutes in the merciless glare of the common law.         my scheme was a marvel of primitive art i would whizz over to camp q, tell lolita her mother was about to undergo a major operation at an invented hospital, and then keep moving with my sleepy nymphet from inn to inn while her mother got better and better and finally died. but as i traveled campward my anxiety grew. i could not bear to think i might not find lolita thereor find, instead, another, scared, lolita clamoring for some family friend not the farlows, thank godshe hardly knew thembut might there not be other people i had not reckoned with finally, i decided to make the longdistance call i had simulated so well a few days before. it was raining hard when i pulled up in a muddy suburb of parkington, just before the fork, one prong of which bypassed the city and led to the highway which crossed the hills to lake climax and camp q. i flipped off the ignition and for quite a minute sat in the car bracing myself for that telephone call, and staring at the rain, at the inundated sidewalk, at a hydrant a hideous thing, really, painted a thick silver and red, extending the red stumps of its arms to be varnished by the rain which like stylized blood dripped upon its argent chains. no wonder that stopping beside those nightmare cripples is taboo. i drove up to a gasoline station. a surprise awaited me when at last the coins had satisfactorily clanked down and a voice was allowed to answer mine.         holmes, the camp mistress, informed me that dolly had gone monday this was wednesday on a hike in the hills with her group and was expected to return rather late today. would i care to come tomorrow, and what was exactlywithout going into details, i said that her mother was hospitalized, that the situation was grave, that the child should not be told it was grave and that she should be ready to leave with me tomorrow afternoon. the two voices parted in an explosion of warmth and good will, and through some freak mechanical flaw all my coins came tumbling back to me with a hittingthejackpot clatter that almost made me laugh despite the disappointment at having to postpone bliss. one wonders if this sudden discharge, this spasmodic refund, was not correlated somehow, in the mind of mcfate, with my having invented that little expedition before ever learning of it as i did now.         what next i proceeded to the business center of parkington and devoted the whole afternoon the weather had cleared, the wet town was like silverandglass to buying beautiful things for lo. goodness, what crazy purchases were prompted by the poignant predilection humbert had in those days for check weaves, bright cottons, frills, puffedout short sleeves, soft pleats, snugfitting bodices and generously full skirts oh lolita, you are my girl, as vee was poes and bea dantes, and what little girl would not like to whirl in a circular skirt and scanties did i have something special in mind coaxing voices asked me. swimming suits we have them in all shades. dream pink, frosted aqua, glans mauve, tulip red, oolala black. what about paysuits slips no slips. lo and i loathed slips.         one of my guides in these matters was an anthropometric entry made by her mother on los twelfth birthday the reader remembers that knowyourchild book. i had the feeling that charlotte, moved by obscure motives of envy and dislike, had added an inch here, a pound there but since the nymphet had no doubt grown somewhat in the last seven months, i thought i could safely accept most of those january measurements hip girth, twentynine inches thigh girth just below the gluteal sulcus, seventeen calf girth and neck circumference, eleven chest circumference, twentyseven upper arm girth, eight waist, twentythree stature, fiftyseven inches weight, seventyeight pounds figure, linear intelligence quotient,  vermiform appendix present, thank god.         apart from measurements, i could of course visualize lolita with hallucinational lucidity and nursing as i did a tingle on my breastbone at the exact spot her silky top had come level once or twice with my heart and feeling as i did her warm weight in my lap so that, in a sense, i was always with lolita as a woman is with child, i was not surprised to discover later that my computation had been more or less correct. having moreover studied a midsummer sale book, it was with a very knowing air that i examined various pretty articles, sport shoes, sneakers, pumps of crushed kid for crushed kids. the painted girl in black who attended to all these poignant needs of mine turned parental scholarship and precise description into commercial euphemisms, such as           petite. another, much older woman, in a white dress, with a pancake makeup, seemed to be oddly impressed by my knowledge of junior fashions perhaps i had a midget for mistress so, when shown a skirt with cute pockets in front, i intentionally put a naive male question and was rewarded by a smiling demonstration of the way the zipper worked in the back of the skirt. i had next great fun with all kinds of shorts and briefsphantom little lolitas dancing, falling, daisying all over the counter. we rounded up the deal with some prim cotton pajamas in popular butcherboy style. humbert, the popular butcher.         there is a touch of the mythological and the enchanted in those large stores where according to ads a career girl can get a complete desktodate wardrobe, and where little sister can dream of the day when her wool jersey will make the boys in the back row of the classroom drool. lifesize plastic figures of snubbednosed children with duncolored, greenish, browndotted, faunish faces floated around me. i realized i was the only shopper in that rather eerie place where i moved about fishlike, in a glaucous aquarium. i sensed strange thoughts form in the minds of the languid ladies that escorted me from counter to counter, from rock ledge to seaweed, and the belts and the bracelets i chose seemed to fall from siren hands into transparent water. i bought an elegant valise, had my purchases put into it, and repaired to the nearest hotel, well pleased with my day.         somehow, in connection with that quiet poetical afternoon of fastidious shopping, i recalled the hotel or inn with the seductive name of the enchanted hunters with charlotte had happened to mention shortly before my liberation. with the help of a guidebook i located it in the secluded town of briceland, a fourhour drive from los camp. i could have telephoned but fearing my voice might go out of control and lapse into coy croaks of broken english, i decided to send a wire ordering a room with twin beds for the next night. what a comic, clumsy, wavering prince charming i was how some of my readers will laugh at me when i tell them the trouble i had with the wording of my telegram what should i put humbert and daughter humberg and small daughter homberg and immature girl homburg and child the droll mistakethe g at the endwhich eventually came through may have been a telepathic echo of these hesitations of mine.         and then, in the velvet of a summer night, my broodings over the philer i had with me oh miserly hamburg was he not a very enchanted hunter as he deliberated with himself over his boxful of magic ammunition to rout the monster of insomnia should he try himself one of those amethyst capsules there were forty of them, all toldforty nights with a frail little sleeper at my throbbing side could i rob myself of one such night in order to sleep certainly not much too precious was each tiny plum, each microscopic planetarium with its live startdust. oh, let me be mawkish for the nonce i am so tired of being cynical.                                             this daily headache in the opaque air of this tombal jail is disturbing, but i must persevere. have written more than a hundred pages and not got anywhere yet. my calendar is getting confused. that must have been around august , . dont think i can go on. heart, headeverything. lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita, lolita. repeat till the page is full, printer.                                             still in parkington. finally, i did achieve an hours slumberfrom which i was aroused by gratuitous and horribly exhausting congress with a small hairy hermaphrodite, a total stranger. by then it was six in the morning, and it suddenly occurred to me it might be a good thing to arrive at the camp earlier than i had said. from parkington i had still a hundred miles to go, and there would be more than that to the hazy hills and briceland. if i had said i would come for dolly in the afternoon, it was only because my fancy insisted on merciful night falling as soon as possible upon my impatience. but now i foresaw all kinds of misunderstandings and was all ajitter lest delay might give her the opportunity of some idle telephone call to ramsdale. however, when at . a.m. i attempted to start, i was confronted by a dead battery, and noon was nigh when at last i left parkington.         i reached my destination around half past two parked my car in a pine grove where a greenshirted, redheaded impish lad stood throwing horseshoes in sullen solitude was laconically directed by him to an office in a stucco cottage in a dying state, had to endure for several minutes the inquisitive commiseration of the camp mistress, a sluttish worn out female with rusty hair. dolly she said was all packed and ready to go. she knew her mother was sick but not critically. would mr. haze, i mean, mr. humbert, care to meet the camp counselors or look at the cabins where the girls live each dedicated to a disney creature or visit the lodge or should charlie be sent over to fetch her the girls were just finishing fixing the dining room for a dance. and perhaps afterwards she would say to somebody or other the poor guy looked like his own ghost.         let me retain for a moment that scene in all its trivial and fateful detail hag holmes writing out a receipt, scratching her head, pulling a drawer out of her desk, pouring change into my impatient palm, then neatly spreading a banknote over it with a bright and five photographs of girlchildren some gaudy moth or butterfly, still alive, safely pinned to the wall nature study the framed diploma of the camps dietitian my trembling hands a card produced by efficient holmes with a report of dolly hazes behavior for july fair to good keen on swimming and boating a sound of trees and birds, and my pounding heart i was standing with my back to the open door, and then i felt the blood rush to my head as i heart her respiration and voice behind me. she arrived dragging and bumping her heavy suitcase. hi she said, and stood still, looking at me with sly, glad eyes, her soft lips parted in a slightly foolish but wonderfully endearing smile.         she was thinner and taller, and for a second it seemed to me her face was less pretty than the mental imprint i had cherished for more than a month her cheeks looked hollowed and too much lentigo camouflaged her rosy rustic features and that first impression a very narrow human interval between two tiger heartbeats carried the clear implication that all widower humbert had to do, wanted to do, or would do, was to give this wanlooking though suncolored little orphan          au yeux battusand even those plumbaceous umbrae under her eyes bore freckles a sound education, a healthy and happy girlhood, a clean home, nice girlfriends of her age among whom if the fates deigned to repay me i might find, perhaps, a pretty little          magdleinfor herr doktor humbert alone. but in a wink, as the germans say, the angelic line of conduct was erased, and i overtook my prey time moves ahead of our fancies, and she was my lolita againin fact, more of my lolita than ever. i let my hand rest on her warm auburn head and took up her bag. she was all rose and honey, dressed in her brightest gingham, with a pattern of little red apples, and her arms and legs were of a deep golden brown, with scratches like tiny dotted lines of coagulated rubies, and the ribbed cuffs of her white socks were turned down at the remembered level, and because of her childish gait, or because i had memorized her as always wearing heelless shoes, her saddle oxfords looked somehow too large and too highheeled for her. goodbye, camp q, merry camp q. goodbye, plain unwholesome food, goodbye charlie boy. in the hot car she settled down beside me, slapped a prompt fly on her lovely knee then, her mouth working violently on a piece of chewing gum, she rapidly cranked down the window on her side and settled back again. we sped through the striped and speckled forest.         hows mother she asked dutifully.         i said the doctors did not quite know yet what the trouble was. anyway, something abdominal. abominable no, abdominal. we would have to hang around for a while. the hospital was in the country, near the gay town of lepingville, where a great poet had resided in the early nineteenth century and where we would take in all the shows. she thought it a peachy idea and wondered if we could make lepingville before nine p.m.         we should be at briceland by dinner time, i said, and tomorrow well visit lepingville. how was the hike did you have a marvelous time at the camp         uhhuh.         sorry to leave         unun.         talk, lodont grunt. tell me something.         what thing, dad she let the word expand with ironic deliberation.         any old thing.         okay, if i call you that eyes slit at the road.         quite.         its a sketch, you know. when did you fall for my mummy         some day, lo, you will understand many emotions and situations, such as for example the harmony, the beauty of spiritual relationship.         bah said the cynical nymphet.         shallow lull in the dialogue, filled with some landscape.         look, lo, at all those cows on that hillside.         i think ill vomit if i look at a cow again.         you know, i missed you terribly, lo.                   idid not. fact ive been revoltingly unfaithful to you, but it does not matter one bit, because youve stopped caring for me, anyway. you drive much faster than my mummy, mister.         i slowed down from a blind seventy to a purblind fifty.         why do you think i have ceased caring for you, lo         well, you havent kissed me yet, have you         inly dying, inly moaning, i glimpsed a reasonably wide shoulder of road ahead, and bumped and wobbled into the weeds. remember she is only a child, remember she is only         hardly had the car come to a standstill than lolita positively flowed into my arms. not daring, not daring let myself gonot even daring let myself realize that          thissweet wetness and trembling fire was the beginning of the ineffable life which, ably assisted by fate, i had finally willed into beingnot daring really kiss her, i touched her hot, opening lips with the utmost piety, tiny sips, nothing salacious but she, with an impatient wriggle, pressed her mouth to mine so hard that i felt her big front teeth and shared in the peppermint taste of her saliva. i knew, of course, it was but an innocent game on her part, a bit of backfisch foolery in imitation of some simulacrum of fake romance, and since as the psychotherapist, as well as the rapist, will tell you the limits and rules of such girlish games are fluid, or at least too childishly subtle for the senior partner to graspi was dreadfully afraid i might go too far and cause her to start back in revulsion and terror. and, as above all i was agonizingly anxious to smuggle her into the hermetic seclusion of the enchanged hunters, and we had still eighty miles to go, blessed intuition broke our embracea split second before a highway patrol car drew up alongside.         florid and beetlebrowed, its driver stared at me         happen to see a blue sedan, same make as yours, pass you before the junction         why, no.         we didnt, said lo, eagerly leaning across me, her innocent hand on my legs, but are you sure it was blue, because         the cop what shadow of us was he after gave the little colleen his best smile and went into a uturn.         we drove on.         the fruithead remarked lo. he should have nabbed          you.         why me for heavens sake         well, the speed in this bum state is fifty, andno, dont slow down, you, dull bulb. hes gone now.         we have still quite a stretch, i said, and i want to get there before dark. so be a good girl.         bad, bad girl, said lo comfortably. juvenile delickwent, but frank and fetching. that light was red. ive never seen such driving.         we rolled silently through a silent townlet.         say, wouldnt mother be absolutely mad if she found out we were lovers         good lord, lo, let us not talk that way.         but we          arelovers, arent we         not that i know of. i think we are going to have some more rain. dont you want to tell me of those little pranks of yours in camp         you talk like a book,          dad.         what have you been up to i insist you tell me.         are you easily shocked         no. go on.         let us turn into a secluded lane and ill tell you.         lo, i must seriously ask you not to play the fool. well         welli joined in all the activities that were offered.                   ensuite         ansooit, i was taught to live happily and richly with others and to develop a wholesome personality. be a cake, in fact.         yes. i saw something of the sort in the booklet.         we loved the sings around the fire in the big stone fireplace or under the darned stars, where every girl merged her own spirit of happiness with the voice of the group.         your memory is excellent, lo, but i must trouble you to leave out the swear words. anything else         the girl scouts motto, said lo rhapsodically, is also mine. i fill my life with worthwhile deeds such aswell, never mind what. my duty isto be useful. i am a friend to male animals. i obey orders. i am cheerful. that was another police car. i am thrifty and i am absolutely filthy in thought, word and deed.         now i do hope thats all, you witty child.         yep. thats all. nowait a sec. we baked in a reflector oven. isnt that terrific         well, thats better.         we washed zillions of dishes. zillions you know is schoolmarms slang for manymanymanymany. oh yes, last but not least, as mother saysnow let me seewhat was it i know we made shadowgraphs. gee, what fun.                   cest bien tout                   cest. except for one little thing, something i simply cant tell you without blushing all over.         will you tell it me later         if we sit in the dark and you let me whisper, i will. do you sleep in your old room or in a heap with mother         old room. your mother may have to undergo a very serious operation, lo.         stop at that candy bar, will you, said lo.         sitting on a high stool, a band of sunlight crossing her bare brown forearm, lolita was served an elaborate icecream concoction topped with synthetic syrup. it was erected and brought her by a pimply brute of a boy in a greasy bowtie who eyed my fragile child in her thin cotton frock with carnal deliberation. my impatience to reach briceland and the enchanted hunters was becoming more than i could endure. fortunately she dispatched the stuff with her usual alacrity.         how much cash do you have i asked.         not a cent, she said sadly, lifting her eyebrows, showing me the empty inside of her money purse.         this is a matter that will be mended in due time, i rejoined archly. are you coming         say, i wonder if they have a washroom.         you are not going there, i said firmly. it is sure to be a vile place. do come on.         she was on the whole an obedient little girl and i kissed her in the neck when we got back into the car.                   dontdo that, she said looking at me with unfeigned surprise. dont drool on me. you dirty man.         she rubbed the spot against her raised shoulder.         sorry, i murmured. im rather fond of you, thats all.         we drove under a gloomy sky, up a winding road, then down again.         well, im also sort of fond of you, said lolita in a delayed soft voice, with a sort of sigh, and sort of settled closer to me.         oh, my lolita, we shall never get there         dusk was beginning to saturate pretty little briceland, its phony colonial architecture, curiosity sops and imported shade trees, when we drove through the weakly lighted streets in search of the enchanted hunters. the air, despite a steady drizzle beading it, was warm and green, and a queue of people, mainly children and old men, had already formed before the box office of a movie house, dripping with jewelfires.         oh, i want to see that picture. lets go right after dinner. oh, lets         we might, chanted humbertknowing perfectly well, the sly tumescent devil, that by nine, when          hisshow began, she would be dead in his arms.         easy cried lo, lurching forward, as an accursed truck in front of us, its backside carbuncles pulsating, stopped at a crossing.         if we did not get to the hotel soon, immediately, miraculously, in the very next block, i felt i would lose all control over the haze jalopy with its ineffectual wipers and whimsical brakes but the passersby i applied to for directions were either strangers themselves or asked with a frown enchanted what as if i were a madman or else they went into such complicated explanations, with geometrical gestures, geographical generalities and strictly local clues then bear south after you hit the courthouse that i could not help losing my way in the maze of their wellmeaning gibberish. lo, whose lovely prismatic entrails had already digested the sweetmeat, was looking forward to a big meal and had begun to fidget. as to me, although i had long become used to a kind of secondary fate mcfates inept secretary, so to speak pettily interfering with the bosss generous magnificent planto grind and grope through the avenues of briceland was perhaps the most exasperating ordeal i had yet faced. in later months i could laugh at my inexperience when recalling the obstinate boyish way in which i had concentrated upon that particular inn with its fancy name for all along our route countless motor courts proclaimed their vacancy in neon lights, ready to accommodate salesmen, escaped convicts, impotents, family groups, as well as the most corrupt and vigorous couples. ah, gentle drivers gliding through summers black nights, what frolics, what twists of lust, you might see from your impeccable highways if kumfy kabins were suddenly drained of their pigments and became as transparent as boxes of glass         the miracle i hankered for did happen after all. a man and a girl, more or less conjoined in a dark car under dripping trees, told us we were in the heart of the park, but had only to turn left at the next traffic light and there we would be. we did not see any next traffic lightin fact, the park was as black as the sins it concealedbut soon after falling under the smooth spell of a nicely graded curve, the travelers became aware of a diamond glow through the mist, then a gleam of lakewater appearedand there it was, marvelously and inexorably, under spectral trees, at the top of a graveled drivethe pale palace of the enchanted hunters.         a row of parked cars, like pigs at a trough, seemed at first sight to forbid access but then, by magic, a formidable convertible, resplendent, rubious in the lighted rain, came into motionwas energetically backed out by a broadshouldered driverand we gratefully slipped into the gap it had left. i immediately regretted my haste for i noticed that my predecessor had now taken advantage of a garagelike shelter nearby where there was ample space for another car but i was too impatient to follow his example.         wow looks swank, remarked my vulgar darling squinting at the stucco as she crept out into the audible drizzle and with a childish hand tweaked loose the frockfold that had struck in the peachcleftto quote robert browning. under the arclights enlarged replicas of chestnut leaves plunged and played on white pillars. i unlocked the trunk compartment. a hunchbacked and hoary negro in a uniform of sorts took our bags and wheeled them slowly into the lobby. it was full of old ladies and clergy men. lolita sank down on her haunches to caress a palefaced, bluefreckled, blackeared cocker spaniel swooning on the floral carpet under her handas who would not, my heartwhile i cleared my throat through the throng to the desk. there a bald porcine old maneverybody was old in that old hotelexamined my features with a polite smile, then leisurely produced my garbled telegram, wrestled with some dark doubts, turned his head to look at the clock, and finally said he was very sorry, he had held the room with the twin beds till half past six, and now it was gone. a religious convention, he said, had clashed with a flower show in briceland, andthe name, i said coldly, is not humberg and not humbug, but herbert, i mean humbert, and any room will do, just put in a cot for my little daughter. she is ten and very tired.         the pink old fellow peered goodnaturedly at lostill squatting, listening in profile, lips parted, to what the dogs mistress, an ancient lady swathed in violet veils, was telling her from the depths of a cretonne easy chair.         whatever doubts the obscene fellow had, they were dispelled by that blossomlike vision. he said, he might still have a room, had one, in factwith a double bed. as to the cot         mr. potts, do we have any cots left potts, also pink and bald, with white hairs growing out of his ears and other holes, would see what could be done. he came and spoke while i unscrewed my fountain pen. impatient humbert         our double beds are really triple, potts cozily said tucking me and

stood, a few feet away from me, and stared at herself contentedly, not unpleasantly surprised at her own appearance, filling with her own rosy sunshine the surprised and pleased closetdoor mirror.         look here, lo. lets settle this once for all. for all practical purposes i am your father. i have a feeling of great tenderness for you. in your mothers absence i am responsible for your welfare. we are not rich, and while we travel, we shall be obligedwe shall be thrown a good deal together. two people sharing one room, inevitably enter into a kindhow shall i saya kind         the word is incest, said loand walked into the closet, walked out again with a young golden giggle, opened the adjoining door, and after carefully peering inside with her strange smoky eyes lest she make another mistake, retired to the bathroom.         i opened the window, tore off my sweatdrenched shirt, changed, checked the pill vial in my coat pocket, unlocked the         she drifted out. i tried to embrace her casually, a bit of controlled tenderness before dinner.         she said look, lets cut out the kissing game and get something to eat.         it was then that i sprang my surprise.         oh, what a dreamy pet she walked up to the open suitcase as if stalking it from afar, at a kind of slowmotion walk, peering at that distant treasure box on the luggage support. was there something wrong, i wondered, with those great gray eyes of hers, or were we both plunged in the same enchanted mist she stepped up to it, lifting her rather highheeled feet rather high, and bending her beautiful boyknees while she walked through dilating space with the lentor of one walking under water or in a flight dream. then she raised by the armlets a coppercolored, charming and quite expensive vest, very slowly stretching it between her silent hands as if she were a bemused birdhunter holding his breath over the incredible bird he spreads out by the tips of its flaming wings. then while i stood waiting for her she pulled out the slow snake of a brilliant belt and tried it on.         then she crept into my waiting arms, radiant, relaxed, caressing me with her tender, mysterious, impure, indifferent, twilight eyesfor all the world, like the cheapest of cheap cuties. for that is what nymphets imitatewhile we moan and die.         whats the katter with misses i muttered wordcontrol gone into her hair.         if you must know, she said, you do it the wrong way.         show, wight ray.         all in good time, responded the spoonerette.                  seva ascendes, pulsata, brulans, kizelans, dementissima.         elevator clatterans, pausa, clatterans, populus in corridoro.         hanc nisi         mors         mihi adimet nemo juncea puellula,         jo         pensavo fondissime, nobserva nihil quidquambut, of course, in another moment i might have committed some dreadful blunder fortunately, she returned to the treasure box.         from the bathroom, where it took me quite a time to shift back into normal gear for a humdrum purpose, i heard, standing, drumming, retaining my breath, my lolitas oos and gees of girlish delight.         she had used the soap only because it was sample soap.         well, come on, my dear, if you are as hungry as i am.         and so to the elevator, daughter swinging her old white purse, father walking in front nota bene never behind, she is not a lady. as we stood now side by side waiting to be taken down, she threw back her head, yawned without restraint and shook her curls.         when did they make you get up at that camp         halfpast she stifled another yawnsixyawn in full with a shiver of all her frame. halfpast, she repeated, her throat filling up again.         the dining room met us with a smell of fried fat and a faded smile. it was a spacious and pretentious place with maudlin murals depicting enchanted hunters in various postures and states of enchantment amid a medley of pallid animals, dryads and trees. a few scattered old ladies, two clergymen, and a man in a sports coat were finishing their meals in silence. the dining room closed at nine, and the greenclad, pokerfaced serving girls were, happily, in a desperate hurry to get rid of us.         does not he look exactly, but exactly, like quilty said lo in a soft voice, her sharp brown elbow not pointing, but visibly burning to point, at the lone diner in the loud checks, in the far corner of the room.         like our fat ramsdale dentist         lo arrested the mouthful of water she had just taken, and put down her dancing glass.         course not, she said with a splutter of mirth. i meant the writer fellow in the dromes ad.         oh, fame oh, femina         when the dessert was plunked downa huge wedge of cherry pie for the young lady and vanilla ice cream her protector, most of which she expeditiously added to her piei produced a small vial containing papas purple pills. as i look back at those seasick murals, at that strange and monstrous moment, i can only explain my behavior then by the mechanism of that dream vacuum wherein revolves a deranged mind but at the time, it all seemed quite simple and inevitable to me. i glanced around, satisfied myself that the last diner had left, removed the stopped, and with the utmost deliberation tipped the philter into my palm. i had carefully rehearsed before a mirror the gesture of clapping my empty hand to my open mouth and swallowing a fictitious pill. as i expected, she pounced upon the vial with its plump, beautifully colored capsules loaded with beautys sleep.         blue she exclaimed. violet blue. what are they made of         summer skies, i said, and plums and figs, and the grapeblood of emperors.         no, seriouslyplease.         oh, just purpills. vitamin x. makes one strong as an ox or an ax. want to try one         lolita stretched out her hand, nodding vigorously.         i had hoped the drug would work fast. it certainly did. she had had a long long day, she had gone rowing in the morning with barbara whose sister was waterfront director, as the adorable accessible nymphet now started to tell me in between suppressed palatehumping yawns, growing in volumeoh, how fast the magic potion workedand had been active in other ways too. the movie that had vaguely loomed in her mind was, of course, by the time we watertreaded out of the dining room, forgotten. as we stood in the elevator, she leaned against me, faintly smilingwouldnt you like me to tell youhalf closing her darklidded eyes. sleepy, huh said uncle tom who was bringing up the quiet francoirish gentleman and his daughter as well as two withered women, experts in roses. they looked with sympathy at my frail, tanned, tottering, dazed rosedarling. i had almost to carry her into our room. there, she sat down on the edge of the bed, swaying a little, speaking in dovedull, longdrawn tones.         if i tell youif i tell you, will you promise sleepy, so sleepyhead lolling, eyes going out, promise you wont make complaints         later, lo. now go to bed. ill leave you here, and you go to bed. give you ten minutes.         oh, ive been such a disgusting girl, she went on, shaking her hair, removing with slow fingers a velvet hair ribbon. lemme tell you         tomorrow, lo. go to bed, go to bedfor goodness sake, to bed.         i pocketed the key and walked downstairs.                                             gentlewomen of the jury bear with me allow me to take just a tiny bit of your precious time. so this was          le grand moment.i had left my lolita still sitting on the edge of the abysmal bed, drowsily raising her foot, fumbling at the shoelaces and showing as she did so the nether side of her thigh up to the crotch of her pantiesshe had always been singularly absentminded, or shameless, or both, in matters of legshow. this, then, was the hermetic vision of her which i had locked inafter satisfying myself that the door carried no inside bolt. the key, with its numbered dangler of carved wood, became forthwith the weighty sesame to a rapturous and formidable future. it was mine, it was part of my hot hairy fist. in a few minutessay, twenty, say halfanhour,          sicher its sicheras my uncle gustave used to sayi would let myself into that  and find my nymphet, my beauty and bride, imprisoned in her crystal sleep. jurors if my happiness could have talked, it would have filled that genteel hotel with a deafening roar. and my only regret today is that i did not quietly deposit key  at the office, and leave the town, the country, the continent, the hemisphere,indeed, the globethat very same night.         let me explain. i was not unduly disturbed by her selfaccusatory innuendoes. i was still firmly resolved to pursue my policy of sparing her purity by operating only in the stealth of night, only upon a completely anesthetized little nude. restraint and reverence were still my mottoeven if that purity incidentally, thoroughly debunked by modern science had been slightly damaged through some juvenile erotic experience, no doubt homosexual, at that accursed camp of hers. of course, in my oldfashioned, oldworld way, i, jeanjacques humbert, had taken for granted, when i first met her, that she was as unravished as the stereotypical notion of normal child had been since the lamented end of the ancient world b.c. and its fascinating practices. we are not surrounded in our enlighted era by little slave flowers that can be casually plucked between business and bath as they used to be in the days of the romans and we do not, as dignified orientals did in still more luxurious times, use tiny entertainers fore and aft between the mutton and the rose sherbet. the whole point is that the old link between the adult world and the child world has been completely severed nowadays by new customs and new laws. despite my having dabbled in psychiatry and social work, i really knew very little about children. after all, lolita was only twelve, and no matter what concessions i made to time and placeeven bearing in mind the crude behavior of american schoolchildreni still was under the impression that whatever went on among those brash brats, went on at a later age, and in a different environment. therefore to retrieve the thread of this explanation the moralist in me bypassed the issue by clinging to conventional notions of what twelveyearold girls should be. the child therapist in me a fake, as most of them arebut no matter regurgitated neofreudian hash and conjured up a dreaming and exaggerating dolly in the latency period of girlhood. finally, the sensualist in me a great and insane monster had no objection to some depravity in his prey. but somewhere behind the raging bliss, bewildered shadows conferredand not to have heeded them, this is what i regret human beings, attend i should have understood that lolita had          alreadyproved to be something quite different from innocent annabel, and that the nymphean evil breathing through every pore of the fey child that i had prepared for my secret delectation, would make the secrecy impossible, and the delectation lethal. i should have known by the signs made to me by something in lolitathe real child lolita or some haggard angel behind her back that nothing but pain and horror would result from the expected rapture. oh, winged gentlemen of the jury         and she was mine, she was mine, the key was in my fist, my fist was in my pocket, she was mine. in the course of evocations and schemes to which i had dedicated so many insomnias, i had gradually eliminated all the superfluous blur, and by stacking level upon level of translucent vision, had evolved a final picture. naked, except for one sock and her charm bracelet, spreadeagled on the bed where my philter had felled herso i foreglimpsed her a velvet hair ribbon was still clutched in her hand her honeybrown body, with the white negative image of a rudimentary swimsuit patterned against her tan, presented to me its pale breastbuds in the rosy lamplight, a little pubic floss glistened on its plump hillock. the cold key with its warm wooden addendum was in my pocket.         i wandered through various public rooms, glory below, gloom above for the look of lust always is gloomy lust is never quite sureeven when the velvety victim is locked up in ones dungeonthat some rival devil or influential god may still not abolish ones prepared triumph. in common parlance, i needed a drink but there was no barroom in that venerable place full of perspiring philistines and period objects.         i drifted to the mens room. there, a person in the clerical blacka hearty party          comme on ditchecking with the assistance of vienna, if it was still there, inquired of me how i had liked dr. boyds talk, and looked puzzled when i king sigmund the second said boyd was quite a boy. upon which, i neatly chucked the tissue paper i had been wiping my sensitive finger tips with into the receptacle provided for it, and sallied lobbyward. comfortably resting my elbows on the counter, i asked mr. potts was he quite sure my wife had not telephoned, and what about that cot he answered she had not she was dead, of course and the cot would be installed tomorrow if we decided to stay on. from a big crowded place called the hunters hall came a sound of many voices discussing horticulture or eternity. another room, called the raspberry room, all bathed in light, with bright little tables and a large one with refreshments, was still empty except for a hostess that type of worn woman with a glassy smile and charlottes manner of speaking she floated up to me to ask if i was mr. braddock, because if so, miss beard had been looking for me. what a name for a woman, i said and strolled away.         in and out of my heart flowed my rainbow blood. i would give her till halfpastnine. going back to the lobby, i found there a change a number of people in floral dresses or black cloth had formed little groups here and there, and some elfish chance offered me the sight of a delightful child of lolitas age, in lolitas type of frock, but pure white, and there was a white ribbon in her black hair. she was not pretty, but she was a nymphet, and her ivory pale legs and lily neck formed for one memorable moment a most pleasurable antiphony in terms of spinal music to my desire for lolita, brown and pink, flushed and fouled. the pale child noticed my gaze which was really quite casual and debonair, and being ridiculously selfconscious, lost countenance completely, rolling her eyes and putting the back of her hand to her cheek, and pulling at the hem of her skirt, and finally turning her thin mobile shoulder blades to me in specious chat with her cowlike mother.         i left the loud lobby and stood outside, on the white steps, looking at the hundreds of powdered bugs wheeling around the lamps in the soggy black night, full of ripple and stir. all i would doall i would dare dowould amount to such a trifle suddenly i was aware that in the darkness next to me there was somebody sitting in a chair on the pillared porch. i could not really see him but what gave him away was the rasp of a screwing off, then a discreet gurgle, then the final note of a placid screwing on. i was about to move away when his voice addressed me         where the devil did you get her         i beg your pardon         i said the weather is getting better.         seems so.         whos the lassie         my daughter.         you lieshes not.         i beg your pardon         i said july was hot. wheres her mother         dead.         i see. sorry. by the way, why dont you two lunch with me tomorrow. that dreadful crowd will be gone by then.         well be gone too. good night.         sorry. im pretty drunk. good night. that child of yours needs a lot of sleep. sleep is a rose, as the persians say. smoke         not now.         he struck a light, but because he was drunk, or because the wind was, the flame illumined not him but another person, a very old man, one of those permanent guests of old hotelsand his white rocker. nobody said anything and the darkness returned to its initial place. then i heard the oldtimer cough and deliver himself of some sepulchral mucus.         i left the porch. at least half an hour in all had elapsed. i ought to have asked for a sip. the strain was beginning to tell. if a violin string can ache, then i was that string. but it would have been unseemly to display any hurry. as i made my way through a constellation of fixed people in one corner of the lobby, there came a blinding flashand beaming dr. braddock, two orchidornamentalized matrons, the small girl in white, and presumably the bared teeth of humbert humbert sidling between the bridelike lassie and the enchanted cleric, were immortalizedinsofar as the texture and print of smalltown newspapers can be deemed immortal. a twittering group had gathered near the elevator. i again chose the stairs.  was near the fire escape. one could stillbut the key was already in the lock, and then i was in the room.                                             the door of the lighted bathroom stood ajar in addition to that, a skeleton glow came though the venetian blind from the outside arclights these intercrossed rays penetrated the darkness of the bedroom and revealed the following situation.         clothed in one of her old nightgowns, my lolita lay on her side with her back to me, in the middle of the bed. her lightly veiled body and bare limbs formed a z. she had put both pillows under her dark rousled head a band of pale light crossed her top vertebrae.         i seemed to have shed my clothes and slipped into pajamas with the kind of fantastic instantaneousness which is implied when in a cinematographic scene the process of changing is cut and i had already placed my knee on the edge of the bed when lolita turned her head and stared at me though the striped shadows.         now this was something the intruder had not expected. the whole pillspiel a rather sordid affair,          entre nous soit dit had had for object a fastness of sleep that a whole regiment would not have disturbed, and here she was staring at me, and thickly calling me barbara. barbara, wearing my pajamas which were much too tight for her, remained poised motionless over the little sleeptalker. softly, with a hopeless sigh, dolly turned away, resuming her initial position. for at least two minutes i waited and strained on the brink, like that tailor with his homemade parachute forty years ago when about to jump from the eiffel tower. her faint breathing had the rhythm of sleep. finally i heaved myself onto my narrow margin of bed, stealthily pulled at the odds and ends of sheets piled up to the south of my stonecold heelsand lolita lifted her head and gaped at me.         as i learned later from a helpful pharmaceutist, the purple pill did not even belong to the big and noble family of barbiturates, and though it might have induced sleep in a neurotic who believed it to be a potent drug, it was too mild a sedative to affect for any length of time a wary, albeit weary, nymphet. whether the ramsdale doctor was a charlatan or a shrewd old rogue, does not, and did not, really matter. what mattered, was that i had been deceived. when lolita opened her eyes again, i realized that whether or not the drug might work later in the night, the security i had relied upon was a sham one. slowly her head turned away and dropped onto her unfair amount of pillow. i lay quite still on my brink, peering at her rumpled hair, at the glimmer of nymphet flesh, where half a haunch and half a shoulder dimly showed, and trying to gauge the depth of her sleep by the rate of her respiration. some time passed, nothing changed, and i decided i might risk getting a little closer to that lovely and maddening glimmer but hardly had i moved into its warm purlieus than her breathing was suspended, and i had the odious feeling that little dolores was wide awake and would explode in screams if i touched her with any part of my wretchedness. please, reader no matter your exasperation with the tenderhearted, morbidly sensitive, infinitely circumspect hero of my book, do not skip these essential pages imagine me i shall not exist if you do not imagine me try to discern the doe in me, trembling in the forest of my own iniquity lets even smile a little. after all, there is no harm in smiling. for instance i almost wrote frinstance, i had no place to rest my head, and a fit of heartburn they call those fries french,          grand dieu was added to my discomfort.         she was again fast asleep, my nymphet, but still i did not dare to launch upon my enchanted voyage.          la petite dormeuse ou lamant ridicule. tomorrow i would stuff her with those earlier pills that had so thoroughly numbed her mummy. in the glove compartmentor in the gladstone bag should i wait a solid hour and then creep up again the science of nympholepsy is a precise science. actual contact would do it in one second flat. an interspace of a millimeter would do it in ten. let us wait.         there is nothing louder than an american hotel and, mind you, this was supposed to be a quiet, cozy, oldfashioned, homey placegracious living and all that stuff. the clatter of the elevators gatesome twenty yards northeast of my head but as clearly perceived as if it were inside my left templealternated with the banging and booming of the machines various evolutions and lasted well beyond midnight. every now and then, immediately east of my left ear always assuming i lay on my back, not daring to direct my viler side toward the nebulous haunch of my bedmate, the corridor would brim with cheerful, resonant and inept exclamations ending in a volley of goodnights. when          thatstopped, a toilet immediately north of my cerebellum took over. it was a manly, energetic, deepthroated toilet, and it was used many times. its gurgle and gush and long afterflow shook the wall behind me. then someone in a southern direction was extravagantly sick, almost coughing out his life with his liquor, and his toilet descended like a veritable niagara, immediately beyond our bathroom. and when finally all the waterfalls had stopped, and the enchanted hunters were sound asleep, the avenue under the window of my insomnia, to the west of my wakea staid, eminently residential, dignified alley of huge treesdegenerated into the despicable haunt of gigantic trucks roaring through the wet and windy night.         and less than six inches from me and my burning life, was nebulous lolita after a long stirless vigil, my tentacles moved towards her again, and this time the creak of the mattress did not awake her. i managed to bring my ravenous bulk so close to her that i felt the aura of her bare shoulder like a warm breath upon my cheek. and then, she sat up, gasped, muttered with insane rapidity something about boats, tugged at the sheets and lapsed back into her rich, dark, young unconsciousness. as she tossed, within that abundant flow of sleep, recently auburn, at present lunar, her arm struck me across the face. for a second i held her. she freed herself from the shadow of my embracedoing this not consciously, not violently, not with any personal distaste, but with the neutral plaintive murmur of a child demanding its natural rest. and again the situation remained the same lolita with her curved spine to humbert, humbert resting his head on his hand and burning with desire and dyspepsia.         the latter necessitated a trip to the bathroom for a draft of water which is the best medicine i know in my case, except perhaps milk with radishes and when i reentered the strange palestriped fastness where lolitas old and new clothes reclined in various attitudes of enchantment on pieces of furniture that seemed vaguely afloat, my impossible daughter sat up and in clear tones demanded a drink, too. she took the resilient and cold paper cup in her shadowy hand and gulped down its contents gratefully, her long eyelashes pointing cupward, and then, with an infantile gesture that carried more charm than any carnal caress, little lolita wiped her lips against my shoulder. she fell back on her pillow i had subtracted mine while she drank and was instantly asleep again.         i had not dared offer her a second helping of the drug, and had not abandoned hope that the first might still consolidate her sleep. i started to move toward her, ready for any disappointment, knowing i had better wait but incapable of waiting. my pillow smelled of her hair. i moved toward my glimmering darling, stopping or retreating every time i thought she stirred or was about to stir. a breeze from wonderland had begun to affect my thoughts, and now they seemed couched in italics, as if the surface reflecting them were wrinkled by the phantasm of that breeze. time and again my consciousness folded the wrong way, my shuffling body entered the sphere of sleep, shuffled out again, and once or twice i caught myself drifting into a melancholy snore. mists of tenderness enfolded mountains of longing. now and then it seemed to me that the enchanted prey was about to meet halfway the enchanted hunter, that her haunch was working its way toward me under the soft sand of a remote and fabulous beach and then her dimpled dimness would stir, and i would know she was farther away from me than ever.         if i dwell at some length on the tremors and groupings of that distant night, it is because i insist upon proving that i am not, and never was, and never could have been, a brutal scoundrel. the gentle and dreamy regions though which i crept were the patrimonies of poets          notcrimes prowling ground. had i reached my goal, my ecstasy would have been all softness, a case of internal combustion of which she would hardly have felt the heat, even if she were wide awake. but i still hoped she might gradually be engulfed in a completeness of stupor that would allow me to taste more than a glimmer of her. and so, in between tentative approximations, with a confusion of perception metamorphosing her into eyespots of moonlight or a fluffy flowering bush, i would dream i regained consciousness, dream i lay in wait.         in the first antemeridian hours there was a lull in the restless hotel night. then around four the corridor toilet cascaded and its door banged. a little after five a reverberating monologue began to arrive, in several installments, from some courtyard or parking place. it was not really a monologue, since the speaker stopped every few seconds to listen presumably to another fellow, but that other voice did not reach me, and so no real meaning could be derived from the part heard. its matteroffact intonations, however, helped to bring in the dawn, and the room was already suffused with lilac gray, when several industrious toilets went to work, one after the other, and the clattering and whining elevator began to rise and take down early risers and downers, and for some minutes i miserably dozed, and charlotte was a mermaid in a greenish tank, and somewhere in the passage dr. boyd said good morning to you in a fruity voice, and birds were busy in the trees, and then lolita yawned.         frigid gentlewomen of the jury i had thought that months, perhaps years, would elapse before i dared to reveal myself to dolores haze but by six she was wide awake, and by six fifteen we were technically lovers. i am going to tell you something very strange it was she who seduced me.         upon hearing her first morning yawn, i feigned handsome profiled sleep. i just did not know what to do. would she be shocked at finding me by her side, and not in some spare bed would she collect her clothes and lock herself up in the bathroom would she demand to be taken at once to ramsdaleto her mothers bedsideback to camp but my lo was a sportive lassie. i felt her eyes on me, and when she uttered at last that beloved chortling note of hers, i knew her eyes had been laughing. she rolled over to my side, and her warm brown hair came against my collarbone. i gave a mediocre imitation of waking up. we lay quietly. i gently caressed her hair, and we gently kissed. her kiss, to my delirious embarrassment, had some rather comical refinements of flutter and probe which made me conclude she had been coached at an early age by a little lesbian. no charlie boy could have taught her          that. as if to see whether i had my fill and learned the lesson, she drew away and surveyed me. her cheekbones were flushed, her full underlip glistened, my dissolution was near. all at once, with a burst of rough glee the sign of the nymphet, she put her mouth to my earbut for quite a while my mind could not separate into words the hot thunder of her whisper, and she laughed, and brushed the hair off her face, and tried again, and gradually the odd sense of living in a brand new, mad new dream world, where everything was permissible, came over me as i realized what she was suggesting. i answered i did not know what game she and charlie had played. you mean you have neverher features twisted into a stare of disgusted incredulity. you have never she started again. i took time out by nuzzling her a little. lay off, will you, she said with a twangy whine, hastily removing her brown shoulder from my lips. it was very curious the way she consideredand kept doing so for a long timeall caresses except kisses on the mouth or the stark act of love either romantic slosh or abnormal.         you mean, she persisted, now kneeling above me, you never did it when you were a kid         never, i answered quite truthfully.         okay, said lolita, here is where we start.         however, i shall not bore my learned readers with a detailed account of lolitas presumption. suffice it to say that not a trace of modesty did i perceive in this beautiful hardly formed young girl whom modern coeducation, juvenile mores, the campfire racket and so forth had utterly and hopelessly depraved. she saw the stark act merely as part of a youngsters furtive world, unknown to adults. what adults did for purposes of procreation was no business of hers. my life was handled by little lo in an energetic, matteroffact manner as if it were an insensate gadget unconnected with me. while eager to impress me with the world of tough kids, she was not quite prepared for certain discrepancies between a kids life and mine. pride alone prevented her from giving up for, in my strange predicament, i feigned supreme stupidity and had her have her wayat least while i could still bear it. but really these are irrelevant matters i am not concerned with socalled sex at all. anybody can imagine those elements of animality. a greater endeavor lures me on to fix once for all the perilous magic of nymphets.                                             i have to tread carefully. i have to speak in a whisper. oh you, veteran crime reporter, you grave old usher, you once popular policeman, now in solitary confinement after gracing that school crossing for years, you wretched emeritus read to by a boy it would never do, would it, to have you fellows fall madly in love with my lolita had i been a painter, had the management of the enchanted hunters lost its mind one summer day and commissioned me to redecorate their dining room with murals of my own making, this is what i might have thought up, let me list some fragments         there would have been a lake. there would have been an arbor in flameflower. there would have been nature studiesa tiger pursuing a bird of paradise, a choking snake sheathing whole the flayed trunk of a shoat. there would have been a sultan, his face expressing great agony belied, as it were, by his molding caress, helping a callypygean slave child to climb a column of onyx. there would have been those luminous globules of gonadal glow that travel up the opalescent sides of juke boxes. there would have been all kinds of camp activities on the part of the intermediate group, canoeing, coranting, combing curls in the lakeside sun. there would have been poplars, apples, a suburban sunday. there would have been a fire opal dissolving within a rippleringed pool, a last throb, a last dab of color, stinging red, smearing pink, a sigh, a wincing child.                                             i am trying to describe these things not to relive them in my present boundless misery, but to sort out the portion of hell and the portion of heaven in that strange, awful, maddening worldnymphet love. the beastly and beautiful merged at one point, and it is that borderline i would like to fix, and i feel i fail to do so utterly. why         the stipulation of the roman law, according to which a girl may marry at twelve, was adopted by the church, and is still preserved, rather tacitly, in some of the united states. and fifteen is lawful everywhere. there is nothing wrong, say both hemispheres, when a brute of forty, blessed by the local priest and bloated with drink, sheds his sweatdrenched finery and thrusts himself up to the hilt into his youthful bride. in such stimulating temperate climates says an old magazine in this prison library as st. louis, chicago and cincinnati, girls mature about the end of their twelfth year. dolores haze was born less than three hundred miles from stimulating cincinnati. i have but followed nature. i am natures faithful hound. why then this horror that i cannot shake off did i deprive her of her flower sensitive gentlewomen of the jury, i was not even her first lover.                                             she told me the way she had been debauched. we ate flavorless mealy bananas, bruised peaches and very palatable potato chips, and          die lleinetold me everything. her voluble but disjointed account was accompanied by many a droll          moue. as i think i have already observed, i especially remember one wry face on an ugh basis jellymouth distended sideways and eyes rolled up in a routine blend of comic disgust, resignation and tolerance for young frailty.         her astounding tale started with an introductory mention of her tentmate of the previous summer, at another camp, a very select one as she put it. that tentmate quite a derelict character, halfcrazy, but a swell kid instructed her in various manipulations. at first, loyal lo refused to tell me her name.         was it grace angel i asked.         she shook her head. no, it wasnt it was the daughter of a big shot. he         was it perhaps rose carmine         no, of course not. her father         was it, then, agnes sheridan perchance         she swallowed and shook her headand then did a double take.         say, how come you know all those kids         i explained.         well, she said. they are pretty bad, some of that school bunch, but not that bad. if you have to know, her name was elizabeth talbot, she goes now to a swanky private school, her father is an executive.         i recalled with a funny pang the frequency with which poor charlotte used to introduce into party chat such elegant tidbits as when my daughter was out hiking last year with the talbot girl.         i wanted to know if either mother learned of those sapphic diversions         gosh no, exhaled limp lo mimicking dread and relief, pressing a falsely fluttering hand to her chest.         i was more interested, however, in heterosexual experience. she had entered the sixth grade at eleven, soon after moving to ramsdale from the middle west. what did she mean by pretty bad         well, the miranda twins had shared the same bed for years, and donald scott, who was the dumbest boy in the school, had done it with hazel smith in his uncles garage, and kenneth knightwho was the brightestused to exhibit himself wherever and whenever he had a chance, and         let us switch to camp q, i said. and presently i got the whole story.         barbara burke, a sturdy blond, two years older than lo and by far the camps best swimmer, had a very special canoe which she shared with lo because i was the only other girl who could make willow island some swimming test, i imagine. through july, every morningmark, reader, every blessed morningbarbara and lo would be helped to carry the boat to onyx or eryx two small lakes in the wood by charlie holmes, the camp mistress son, aged thirteenand the only human male for a couple of miles around excepting an old meek stonedeaf handyman, and a farmer in an old ford who sometimes sold the campers eggs as farmers will every morning, oh my reader, the three children would take a short cut through the beautiful innocent forest brimming with all the emblems of youth, dew, birdsongs, and at one point, among the luxuriant undergrowth, lo would be left as sentinel, while barbara and the boy copulated behind a bush.         at first, lo had refused to try what it was like, but curiosity and camaraderie prevailed, and soon she and barbara were doing it by turns with the silent, coarse and surly but indefatigable charlie, who had as much sex appeal as a raw carrot but sported a fascinating collection of contraceptives which he used to fish out of a third nearby lake, a considerably larger and more populous one, called lake climax, after the booming young factory town of that name. although conceding it was sort of fun and fine for the complexion, lolita, i am glad to say, held charlies mind and manners in the greatest contempt. nor had her temperament been roused by that filthy fiend. in fact, i think he had rather stunned it, despite the fun.         by that time it was close to ten. with the ebb of lust, an ashen sense of awfulness, abetted by the realistic drabness of a gray neuralgic day, crept over me and hummed within my temples. brown, naked, frail lo, her narrow white buttocks to me, her sulky face to a door mirror, stood, arms akimbo, feet in new slippers with pussyfur tops wide apart, and through a forechanging lock tritely mugged at herself in the glass. from the corridor came the cooing voices of colored maids at work, and presently there was a mild attempt to open the door of our room. i had lo go to the bathroom and take a muchneeded soap shower. the bed was a frightful mess with overtones of potato chips. she tried on a twopiece navy wool, then a sleeveless blouse with a swirly clathrate skirt, but the first was too tight and the second too ample, and when i begged her to hurry up the situation was beginning to frighten me, lo viciously sent those nice presents of mine hurtling into a corner, and put on yesterdays dress. when she was ready at last, i gave her a lovely new purse of simulated calf in which i had slipped quite a few pennies and two mintbright dimes and told her to buy herself a magazine in the lobby.         ill be down in a minute, i said. and if i were you, my dear, i would not talk to strangers.         except for my poor little gifts, there was not much to pack but i was forced to devote a dangerous amount of time was she up to something downstairs to arranging the bed in such a way as to suggest the abandoned nest of a restless father and his tomboy daughter, instead of an exconvicts saturnalia with a couple of fat old whores. then i finished dressing and had the hoary bellboy come up for the bags.         everything was fine. there, in the lobby, she sat, deep in an overstuffed bloodred armchair, deep in a lurid movie magazine. a fellow of my age in tweeds the genre of the place had changed overnight to a spurious countrysquire atmosphere was staring at my lolita over his dead cigar and stale newspaper. she wore her professional white socks and saddle oxfords, and that bright print frock with the square throat a splash of jaded lamplight brought out the golden down on her warm brown limbs. there she sat, her legs carelessly highcrossed, and her pale eyes skimming along the lines with every now and then a blink. bills wife had worshipped him from afar long before they ever met in fact, she used to secretly admire the famous young actor as he ate sundaes in schwabs drugstore. nothing could have been more childish than her snubbed nose, freckled face or the purplish spot on her naked neck where a fairytale vampire had feasted, or the unconscious movement of her tongue exploring a touch of rosy rash around her swollen lips nothing could be more harmless than to read about jill, an energetic starlet who made her own clothes and was a student of serious literature nothing could be more innocent than the part in that glossy brown hair with that silky sheen on the temple nothing could be more naivebut what sickening envy the lecherous fellow whoever he wascome to think of it, he resembled a little my swiss uncle gustave, also a great admirer of          le dcouvertwould have experienced had he known that every nerve in me was still anointed and ringed with the feel of her bodythe body of some immortal demon disguised as a female child.         was pink pig mr. swoon absolutely sure my wife had not telephoned he was. if she did, would he tell her we had gone on to aunt clares place he would, indeedie. i settled the bill and roused lo from her chair. she read to the car. still reading, she was driven to a socalled coffee shop a few blocks south. oh, she ate all right. she even laid aside her magazine to eat, but a queer dullness had replaced her usual cheerfulness. i knew little lo could be very nasty, so i braced myself and grinned, and waited for a squall. i was unbathed, unshaven, and had had no bowel movement. my nerves were ajangle. i did not like the way my little mistress shrugged her shoulders and distended her nostrils when i attempted casual small talk. had phyllis been in the know before she joined her parents in maine i asked with a smile. look, said lo making a weeping grimace, let us get off the subject. i then triedalso unsuccessfully, no matter how i smacked my lipsto interest her in the road map. our destination was, let me remind my patient reader whose meek temper lo ought to have copied, the gay town of lepingville, somewhere near a hypothetical hospital. that destination was in itself a perfectly arbitrary one as, alas, so many were to be, and i shook in my shoes as i wondered how to keep the whole arrangement plausible, and what other plausible objectives to invent after we had taken in all the movies in lepingville. more and more uncomfortable did humbert feel. it was something quite special, that feeling an oppressive, hideous constraint as if i were sitting with the small ghost of somebody i had just killed.         as she was in the act of getting back into the car, an expression of pain flitted across los face. it flitted again, more meaningfully, as she settled down beside me. no doubt, she reproduced it that second time for my benefit. foolishly, i asked her what was the matter. nothing, you brute, she replied. you what i asked. she was silent. leaving briceland. loquacious lo was silent. cold spiders of panic crawled down my back. this was an orphan. this was a lone child, an absolute waif, with whom a heavylimbed, foulsmelling adult had had strenuous intercourse three times that very morning. whether or not the realization of a lifelong dream had surpassed all expectation, it had, in a sense, overshot its markand plunged into a nightmare. i had been careless, stupid, and ignoble. and let me be quite frank somewhere at the bottom of that dark turmoil i felt the writhing of desire again, so monstrous was my appetite for that miserable nymphet. mingled with the pangs of guilt was the agonizing through that her mood might prevent me from making love to her again as soon as i found a nice country road where to park in peace. in other words, poor humbert humbert was dreadfully unhappy, and while steadily and inanely driving toward lepingville, he kept racking his brains for some quip, under the bright wing of which he might dare turn to his seatmate. it was she, however, who broke the silence         oh, a squashed squirrel, she said. what a shame.         yes, isnt it eager, hopeful hum.         let us stop at the next gas station, lo continued. i want to go to the washroom.         we shall stop wherever you want, i said. and then as a lovely, lonely, supercilious grove oaks, i thought american trees at that stage were beyond me started to echo greenly the rush of our car, a red and ferny road on our right turned its head before slanting into the woodland, and i suggested we might perhaps         drive on, my lo cried shrilly.         righto. take it easy. down, poor beast, down.         i glanced at her. thank god, the child was smiling.         you chump, she said, sweetly smiling at me. you revolting creature. i was a daisyfresh girl, and look what youve done to me. i ought to call the police and tell them you raped me. oh, you dirty, dirty old man.         was she just joking an ominous hysterical note rang through her silly words. presently, making a sizzling sound with her lips, she started complaining of pains, said she could not sit, said i had torn something inside her. the sweat rolled down my neck, and we almost ran over some little animal or other that was crossing the road with tail erect, and again my viletempered companion called me an ugly name. when we stopped at the filling station, she scrambled out without a word and was a long time away. slowly, lovingly, an elderly friend with a broken nose wiped my windshieldthey do it differently at every place, from chamois cloth to soapy brush, this fellow used a pink sponge.         she appeared at last. look, she said in that neutral voice that hurt me so, give me some dimes and nickels. i want to call mother in that hospital. whats the number         get in, i said. you cant call that number.         why         get in and slam the door.         she got in and slammed the door. the old garage man beamed at her. i swung onto the highway.         why cant i call my mother if i want to         because, i answered, your mother is dead.                                             in the gay town of lepingville i bought her four books of comics, a box of candy, a box of sanitary pads, two cokes, a manicure set, a travel clock with a luminous dial, a ring with a real topaz, a tennis racket, roller skates with white high shoes, field glasses, a portable radio set, chewing gum, a transparent raincoat, sunglasses, some more garmentsswooners, shorts, all kinds of summer frocks. at the hotel we had separate rooms, but in the middle of the night she came sobbing into mine, and we made it up very gently. you see, she had absolutely nowhere else to go.                                                             it was then that began our extensive travels all over the states. to any other type of tourist accommodation i soon grew to prefer the functional motelclean, neat, safe nooks, ideal places for sleep, argument, reconciliation, insatiable illicit love. at first, in my dread of arousing suspicion, i would eagerly pay for both sections of one double unit, each containing a double bed. i wondered what type of foursome this arrangement was even intended for, since only a pharisaic parody of privacy could be attained by means of the incomplete partition dividing the cabin or room into two communicating love nests. by and by, the very possibilities that such honest promiscuity suggested two young couples merrily swapping mates or a child shamming sleep to earwitness primal sonorities made me bolder, and every now and then i would take a bedandcot or twinbed cabin, a prison cell or paradise, with yellow window shades pulled down to create a morning illusion of venice and sunshine when actually it was pennsylvania and rain.         we came to know          nous connmes,to use a flaubertian intonationthe stone cottages under enormous chateaubriandesque trees, the brick unit, the adobe unit, the stucco court, on what the tour book of the automobile association describes as shaded or spacious or landscaped grounds. the log kind, finished in knotty pine, reminded lo, by its goldenbrown glaze, of friendchicken bones. we held in contempt the plain whitewashed clapboard kabins, with their faint sewerish smell or some other gloomy selfconscious stench and nothing to boast of except good beds, and an unsmiling landlady always prepared to have her gift well, i could give you turned down.                  nous connmesthis is royal fun the wouldbe enticements of their repetitious namesall those sunset motels, ubeam cottages, hillcrest courts, pine view courts, mountain view courts, skyline courts, park plaza courts, green acres, macs courts. there was sometimes a special line in the writeup, such as children welcome, pets allowed           youare welcome,          youare allowed. the baths were mostly tiled showers, with an endless variety of spouting mechanisms, but with one definitely nonlaodicean characteristic in common, a propensity, while in use, to turn instantly beastly hot or blindingly cold upon you, depending on whether your neighbor turned on his cold or his hot to deprive you of a necessary complement in the shower you had so carefully blended. some motels had instructions pasted above the toilet on whose tank the towels were unhygienically heaped asking guests not to throw into its bowl garbage, beer cans, cartons, stillborn babies others had special notices under glass, such as things to do riding          you will often see riders coming down main street on their way back from a romantic moonlight ride.often at  a.m., sneered unromantic lo.                  nous connmesthe various types of motor court operators, the reformed criminal, the retired teacher and the business flop, among the males and the motherly, pseudoladylike and madamic variants among the females. and sometimes trains would cry in the monstrously hot and humid night with heartrending and ominous plangency, mingling power and hysteria in one desperate scream.         we avoided tourist homes, country cousins of funeral ones, oldfashioned, genteel and showerless, with elaborate dressing tables in depressingly whiteandpink little bedrooms, and photographs of the landladys children in all their instars. but i did surrender, now and then, to los predilection for real hotels. she would pick out in the book, while i petted her in the parked car in the silence of a duskmellowed, mysterious sideroad, some highly recommended lake lodge which offered all sorts of things magnified by the flashlight she moved over them, such as congenial company, betweenmeals snacks, outdoor barbecuesbut which in my mind conjured up odious visions of stinking high school boys in sweatshirts and an emberred cheek pressing against hers, while poor dr. humbert, embracing nothing but two masculine knees, would coldhumor his piles on the damp turf. most empty to her, too, were those colonial inns, which apart from gracious atmosphere and picture windows, promised unlimited quantities of mmm food. treasured recollections of my fathers palatial hotel sometimes led me to seek for its like in the strange country we traveled through. i was soon discouraged but lo kept following the scent of rich food ads, while i derived a not exclusively economic kick from such roadside signs as timber hotel,          children under  free.on the other hand, i shudder when recalling that          soidisanthighclass resort in a midwestern state, which advertised raidtheicebox midnight snacks and, intrigued by my accent, wanted to know my dead wifes and dead mothers maiden names. a twodays stay there cost me a hundred and twentyfour dollars and do you remember, miranda, that other ultrasmart robbers den with complimentary morning coffee and circulating ice water, and no children under sixteen no lolitas, of course         immediately upon arrival at one of the plainer motor courts which became our habitual haunts, she would set the electric fan awhirr, or induce me to drop a quarter into the radio, or she would read all the signs and inquire with a whine why she could not go riding up some advertised trail or swimming in that local pool of warm mineral water. most often, in the slouching, bored way she cultivated, lo would fall prostrate and abominably desirable into a red springchair or a green chaise longue, or a steamer chair of striped canvas with footrest and canopy, or a sling chair, or any other lawn chair under a garden umbrella on the patio, and it would take hours of blandishments, threats and promises to make her lend me for a few seconds her brown limbs in the seclusion of the fivedollar room before undertaking anything she might prefer to my poor joy.         a combination of navet and deception, of charm and vulgarity, of blue silks and rosy mirth, lolita, when she chose, could be a most exasperating brat. i was not really quite prepared for her fits of disorganized boredom, intense and vehement griping, her sprawling, droopy, dopeyeyed style, and what is called goofing offa kind of diffused clowning which she thought was tough in a boyish hoodlum way. mentally, i found her to be a disgustingly conventional little girl. sweet hot jazz, square dancing, gooey fudge sundaes, musicals, movie magazines and so forththese were the obvious items in her list of beloved things. the lord knows how many nickels i fed to the gorgeous music boxes that came with every meal we had i still hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her, people with names like sammy and jo and eddy and tony and peggy and guy and patty and rex, and sentimental song hits, all of them as similar to my ear as her various candies were to my palate. she believed, with a kind of celestial trust, any advertisement or advice that that appeared in          movie loveor          screen landstarasil starves pimples, or you better watch out if youre wearing your shirttails outside your jeans, gals, because jill says you shouldnt. if a roadside sign said visit our gift shopwe          hadto visit it,          hadto buy its indian curios, dolls, copper jewelry, cactus candy. the words novelties and souvenirs simply entranced her by their trochaic lilt. if some caf sign proclaimed icecold drinks, she was automatically stirred, although all drinks everywhere were icecold. she it was to whom ads were dedicated the ideal consumer, the subject and object of every foul poster. and she attemptedunsuccessfullyto patronize only those restaurants where the holy spirit of huncan dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottagecheesecrested salads.         in those days, neither she nor i had thought up yet the system of monetary bribes which was to work such havoc with my nerves and her morals somewhat later. i relied on three other methods to keep my pubescent concubine in submission and passable temper. a few years before, she had spent a rainy summer under miss phalens bleary eye in a dilapidated appalachian farmhouse that had belonged to some gnarled haze or other in the dead past. it still stood among its rank acres of golden rod on the edge of a flowerless forest, at the end of a permanently muddy road, twenty miles from the nearest hamlet. lo recalled that scarecrow of a house, the solitude, the soggy old pastures, the wind, the bloated wilderness, with an energy of disgust that distorted her mouth and fattened her halfrevealed tongue. and it was there that i warned her she would dwell with me in exile for months and years if need be, studying under me french and latin, unless her present attitude changed. charlotte, i began to understand you         a simple child, lo would scream no and frantically clutch at my driving hand whenever i put a stop to her tornadoes of temper by turning in the middle of a highway with the implication that i was about to take her straight to that dark and dismal abode. the farther, however, we traveled away from it west, the less tangible that menace became, and i had to adopt other methods of persuasion.         among these, the reformatory threat is the one i recall with the deepest moan of shame. from the very beginning of our concourse, i was clever enough to realize that i must secure her complete cooperation in keeping our relations secret, that it should become a second nature with her, no matter what grudge she might bear me, no matter what other pleasure she might seek.         come and kiss your old man, i would say, and drop that moody nonsense. in former times, when i was still your dream male the reader will notice what pains i took to speak los tongue, you swooned to records of the number one throbandsob idol of your coevals lo of my what speak english. that idol of your pals sounded, you thought, like friend humbert. but now, i am just your          old man, a dream dad protecting his dream daughter.         my          chre dolorsi want to protect you, dear, from all the horrors that happen to little girls in coal sheds and alley ways, and alas,          comme vous le savez trop bien, ma gentille, in the blueberry woods during the bluest of summers. through thick and thin i will still stay your guardian, and if you are good, i hope a court may legalize that guardianship before long. let us, however, forget, dolores haze, socalled legal terminology, terminology that accepts as rational the term lewd and lascivious cohabitation. i am not a criminal sexual psychopath taking indecent liberties with a child. the rapist was charlie holmes i am the therapista matter of nice spacing in the way of distinction. i am your daddum, lo. look, ive a learned book here about young girls. look, darling, what it says. i quote the normal girlnormal, mark youthe normal girl is usually extremely anxious to please her father. she feels in him the forerunner of the desired elusive male elusive is good, by polonius. the wise mother and your poor mother would have been wise, had she lived will encourage a companionship between father and daughter, realizingexcuse the corny stylethat the girl forms her ideals of romance and of men from her association with her father. now, what association does this cheery book meanand recommend i quote again among sicilians sexual relations between a father and his daughter are accepted as a matter of course, and the girl who participates in such relationship is not looked upon with disapproval by the society of which she is part. im a great admirer of sicilians, fine athletes, fine musicians, fine upright people, lo, and great lovers. but lets not digress. only the other day we read in the newspapers some bunkum about a middleaged morals offender who pleaded guilty to the violation of the mann act and to transporting a nineyearold girl across state lines for immoral purposes, whatever these are. dolores darling you are not nine but almost thirteen, and i would not advise you to consider yourself my crosscountry slave, and i deplore the mann act as lending itself to a dreadful pun, the revenge that the gods of semantics take against tightzippered philistines. i am your father, and i          amspeaking english, and i love you.         finally, let us see what happens if you, a minor, accused of having impaired the morals of an adult in a respectable inn, what happens if you complain to the police of my having kidnapped and raped you let us suppose they believe you. a minor female, who allows a person over twentyone to know her carnally, involves her victim into statutory rape, or seconddegree sodomy, depending on the technique and the maximum penalty is ten years. so, i go to jail. okay. i go to jail. but what happens to you, my orphan well, you are luckier. you become the ward of the department of public welfarewhich i am afraid sounds a little bleak. a nice grim matron of the miss phalen type, but more rigid and not a drinking woman, will take away your lipstick and fancy clothes. no more gadding about i dont know if you have ever heard of the laws relating to dependent, neglected, incorrigible and delinquent children. while i stand gripping the bars, you, happy neglected child, will be given a choice of various dwelling places, all more or less the same, the correctional school, the reformatory, the juvenile detention home, or one of those admirable girls protectories where you knit things, and sing hymns, and have rancid pancakes on sundays. you will go there, lolita          mylolita,          thislolita will leave plainer words, if we two are found out, you will be analyzed and institutionalized, my pet,          cest tout. you will dwell, my lolita will dwell come here, my brown flower with thirtynine other dopes in a dirty dormitory no, allow me, please under the supervision of hideous matrons. this is the situation, this is the choice. dont you think that under the circumstances dolores haze had better stick to her old man         by rubbing all this in, i succeeded in terrorizing lo, who despite a certain brash alertness of manner and spurts of wit was not as intelligent a child as her i.q. might suggest. but if i managed to establish that background of shared secrecy and shared guilt, i was much less successful in keeping her in good humor. every morning during our yearlong travels i had to devise some expectation, some special point in space and time for her to look forward to, for her to survive till bedtime. otherwise, deprived of a shaping and sustaining purpose, the skeleton of her day sagged and collapsed. the object in view might be anythinga lighthouse in virginia, a natural cave in arkansas converted to a caf, a collection of guns and violins somewhere in oklahoma, a replica of the grotto of lourdes in louisiana, shabby photographs of the bonanza mining period in the local museum of a rocky mountains resort, anything whatsoeverbut it had to be there, in front of us, like a fixed star, although as likely as not lo would feign gagging as soon as we got to it.         by putting the geography of the united states into motion, i did my best for hours on end to give her the impression of going places, of rolling on to some definite destination, to some unusual delight. i have never seen such smooth amiable roads as those that now radiated before us, across the crazy quilt of fortyeight states. voraciously we consumed those long highways, in rapt silence we glided over their glossy black dance floors. not only had lo no eye for scenery but she furiously resented my calling her attention to this or that enchanting detail of landscape which i myself learned to discern only after being exposed for quite a time to the delicate beauty ever present in the margin of our undeserving journey. by a paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland northamerican countryside had at first seemed to me something i accepted with a shock of amused recognition because of those painted oilclothes which were imported from america in the old days to be hung above washstands in centraleuropean nurseries, and which fascinated a drowsy child at bed time with the rustic green views they depictedopaque curly trees, a barn, cattle, a brook, the dull white of vague orchards in bloom, and perhaps a stone fence or hills of greenish gouache. but gradually the models of those elementary rusticities became stranger and stranger to the eye, the nearer i came to know them. beyond the tilled plain, beyond the toy roofs, there would be a slow suffusion of inutile loveliness, a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm, peeledpeach tinge pervading the upper edge of a twodimensional, dovegray cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist. there might be a line of spaced trees silhouetted against the horizon, and hot still noons above a wilderness of clover, and claude lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into misty azure with only their cumulus part conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background. or again, it might be a stern el greco horizon, pregnant with inky rain, and a passing glimpse of some mummynecked farmer, and all around alternating strips of quicksilverish water and harsh green corn, the whole arrangement opening like a fan, somewhere in kansas.         now and then, in the vastness of those plains, huge trees would advance toward us to cluster selfconsciously by the roadside and provide a bit of humanitarian shade above a picnic table, with sun flecks, flattened paper cups, samaras and discarded icecream sticks littering the brown ground. a great user of roadside facilities, my unfastidious lo would be charmed by toilet signsguysgals, johnjane, jackjill and even bucksdoes while lost in an artists dream, i would stare at the honest brightness of the gasoline paraphernalia against the splendid green of oaks, or at a distant hill scrambling outscarred but still untamedfrom the wilderness of agriculture that was trying to swallow it.         at night, tall trucks studded with colored lights, like dreadful giant christmas trees, loomed in the darkness and thundered by the belated little sedan. and again next day a thinly populated sky, losing its blue to the heat, would melt overhead, and lo would clamor for a drink, and her cheeks would hollow vigorously over the straw, and the car inside would be a furnace when we got in again, and the road shimmered ahead, with a remote car changing its shape miragelike in the surface glare, and seeming to hang for a moment, oldfashionedly square and high, in the hot haze. and as we pushed westward, patches of what the garageman called sage brush appeared, and then the mysterious outlines of tablelike hills, and then red bluffs inkblotted with junipers, and then a mountain range, dun grading into blue, and blue into dream, and the desert would meet us with a steady gale, dust, gray thorn bushes, and hideous bits of tissue paper mimicking pale flowers among the prickles of windtortured withered stalks all along the highway in the middle o which there sometimes stood simple cows, immobilized in a position tail left, white eyelashes right cutting across all human rules of traffic.         my lawyer has suggested i give a clear, frank account of the itinerary we followed, and i suppose i have reached here a point where i cannot avoid that chore. roughly, during that mad year august  to august , our route began with a series of wiggles and whorls in new england, then meandered south, up and down, east and west dipped deep into          ce quon appelledixieland, avoided florida because the farlows were there, veered west, zigzagged through corn belts and cotton belts this is not          tooclear i am afraid, clarence, but i did not keep any notes, and have at my disposal only an atrociously crippled tour book in three volumes, almost a symbol of my torn and tattered past, in which to check these recollections crossed and recrossed the rockies, straggled through southern deserts where we wintered reached the pacific, turned north through the pale lilac fluff of flowering shrubs along forest roads almost reached the canadian border and proceeded east, across good lands and bad lands, back to agriculture on a grand scale, avoiding, despite little los strident remonstrations, little los birthplace, in a corn, coal and hog producing area and finally returned to the fold of the east, petering out in the college town of beardsley.                                             now, in perusing what follows, the reader should bear in mind not only the general circuit as adumbrated above, with its many sidetrips and tourist traps, secondary circles and skittish deviations, but also the fact that far from being an indolent          partie de plaisir, our tour was a hard, twisted, teleological growth, whose sole          raison dtrethese french clichs are symptomatic was to keep my companion in passable humor from kiss to kiss.         thumbing through that battered tour book, i dimly evoke that magnolia garden in a southern state which cost me four bucks and which, according to the ad in the book, you must visit for three reasons because john galsworthy a stonedead writer of sorts acclaimed it as the worlds fairest garden because in  baedekers guide had marked it with a star and finally, because o, reader, my reader, guess because children and by jingo was not my lolita a child will walk starryeyed and reverently through this foretaste of heaven, drinking in beauty that can influence a life. not mine, said grim lo, and settled down on a bench with the fillings of two sunday papers in her lovely lap.         we passed and repassed through the whole gamut of american roadside restaurants, from the lowly eat with its deer head dark trace of long tear at inner canthus, humorous picture post cards of the posterior kurort type, impaled guest checks, life savers, sunglasses, adman visions of celestial sundaes, one half of a chocolate cake under glass, and several horribly experienced flies zigzagging over the sticky sugarpour on the ignoble counter and all the way to the expensive place with the subdued lights, preposterously poor table linen, inept waiters exconvicts or college boys, the roan back of a screen actress, the sable eyebrows of her male of the moment, and an orchestra of zootsuiters with trumpets.         we inspected the worlds largest stalagmite in a cave where three southeastern states have a family reunion admission by age adults one dollar, pubescents sixty cents. a granite obelisk commemorating the battle of blue licks, with old bones and indian pottery in the museum nearby, lo a dime, very reasonable. the present log cabin boldly simulating the past log cabin where lincoln was born. a boulder, with a plaque, in memory of the author of trees by now we are in poplar cove, n.c., reached by what my kind, tolerant, usually so restrained tour book angrily calls a very narrow road, poorly maintained, to which, though no kilmerite, i subscribe. from a hired motorboat operated by an elderly, but still repulsively handsome white russian, a baron they said los palms were damp, the little fool, who had known in california good old maximovich and valeria, we could distinguish the inaccessible millionaires colony on an island, somewhere off the georgia coast. we inspected further a collection of european hotel picture post cards in a museum devoted to hobbies at a mississippi resort, where with a hot wave of pride i discovered a colored photo of my fathers mirana, its striped awnings, its flag flying above the retouched palm trees. so what said lo, squinting at the bronzed owner of an expensive car who had followed us into the hobby house. relics of the cotton era. a forest in arkansas and, on her brown shoulder, a raised purplepink swelling the work of some gnat which i eased of its beautiful

heck of it. a patch of beautifully eroded clay and yucca blossoms, so pure, so waxy, but lousy with creeping white flies. independence, missouri, the starting point of the old oregon trail and

with green round oaks a last rufous mountain with a rich rug of lucerne at its foot.         moreover, we inspected little iceberg lake, somewhere in colorado, and the snow banks, and the cushionets of tiny alpine flowers, and more snow down which lo in redpeaked cap tried to slide, and squealed, and was snowballed by some youngsters, and retaliated in kind          comme on dit.skeletons of

it cast on the aquamarine lake. a motel whose ventilator pipe passed under the city sewer. lincolns home, largely spurious, with parlor books and period furniture that most visitors reverently accepted as personal belongings.         we had rows, minor and major. the biggest ones we had took place at lacework cabins, virginia on park avenue, little rock, near a school on milner pass, , feet high, in colorado at the corner of seventh street and central avenue in phoenix, arizona on third street, los angeles, because the tickets to some studio or other were sold out at a motel called poplar shade in utah, where six pubescent trees were scarcely taller than my lolita, and where she asked,          propos de rien, how long did i think we were going to live in stuffy cabins, doing filthy things together and never behaving like ordinary people on n. broadway, burns, oregon, corner of w. washington, facing safeway, a grocery. in some little town in the sun valley of idaho, before

silo. and on mcewen st., corner of wheaton ave., in a michigan town bearing his first name.         we came to know the curious roadside species, hitchhiking man,          homo pollexof science, with all its many subspecies and forms the modest soldier, spic and span, quietly waiting, quietly conscious of khakis viatric appeal the schoolboy wishing to go two blocks the killer wishing to go two thousand miles the mysterious, nervous, elderly gent, with brandnew suitcase and clipped mustache a trio of optimistic mexicans the college student displaying the grime of vacational outdoor work as proudly as the name of the famous college arching across the front of his sweatshirt the desperate lady whose battery has just died on her the cleancut, glossyhaired, shiftyeyed, whitefaced young beasts in loud shirts and coats, vigorously, almost priapically thrusting out tense thumbs to tempt lone women or sadsack salesmen with fancy cravings.         lets take him, lo would often plead, rubbing her knees together in a way she had, as some particularly disgusting          pollex, some man of my age and shoulder breadth, with the          face claquesof unemployed actor, walked backwards, practically in the path of our car.         oh, i had to keep a very sharp eye on lo, little limp lo owing perhaps to constant amorous exercise, she radiated, despite her very childish appearance, some special languorous glow which threw garage fellows, hotel pages, vacationists, goons in luxurious cars, maroon morons near blued pools, into fits of concupiscence which might have tickled my pride, had it not incensed my jealousy. for little lo was aware of that glow of hers, and i would often catch her          coulant un regardin the direction of some amiable male, some grease monkey, with a sinewy goldenbrown forearm and watchbraceleted wrist, and hardly had i turned my back to go and buy this very lo a lollipop, than i would hear her and the fair mechanic burst into a perfect love song of wisecracks.         when, during our longer stops, i would relax after a particularly violent morning in bed, and out of the goodness of my lulled heart allow herindulgent humto visit the rose garden or childrens library across the street with a motor court neighbors plain little mary and marys eightyearold brother, lo would come back an hour late, with barefoot mary trailing far behind, and the little boy metamorphosed into two gangling, goldenhaired high school uglies, all muscles and gonorrhea. the reader may well imagine what i answered my pet whenrather uncertainly, i admitshe would ask me if she could go with carl and al here to the rollerskating rink.         i remember the first time, a dusty windy afternoon, i did let her go to one such rink. cruelly she said it would be no fun if i accompanied her, since that time of day was reserved for teenagers. we wrangled out a compromise i remained in the car, among other empty cars with their noses to the canvastopped openair rink, where some fifty young people, many in pairs, were endlessly rolling round and round to mechanical music, and the wind silvered the trees. dolly wore blue jeans and white high shoes, as most of the other girls did. i kept counting the revolutions of the rolling crowdand suddenly she was missing. when she rolled past again, she was together with three hoodlums whom i had heard analyze a moment before the girl skaters from the outsideand jeer at a lovely leggy young thing who had arrived clad in red shorts instead of those jeans and slacks.         at inspection stations on highways entering arizona or california, a policemans cousin would peer with such intensity at us that my poor heart wobbled. any honey he would inquire, and every time my sweet fool giggled. i still have, vibrating all along my optic nerve, visions of lo on horseback, a link in the chain of a guided trip along a bridle trail lo bobbing at a walking pace, with an old woman rider in front and a lecherous rednecked duderancher behind and i behind him, hating his fat floweryshirted back even more fervently than a motorist does a slow truck on a mountain road. or else, at a ski lodge, i would see her floating away from me, celestial and solitary, in an ethereal chairlift, up and up, to a glittering summit where laughing athletes stripped to the waist were waiting for her, for her.         in whatever town we stopped i would inquire, in my polite european way, anent the whereabouts of natatoriums, museums, local schools, the number of children in the nearest school and so forth and at school bus time, smiling and twitching a little i discovered this          tic nerveuxbecause cruel lo was the first to mimic it, i would park at a strategic point, with my vagrant schoolgirl beside me in the car, to watch the children leave schoolalways a pretty sight. this sort of thing soon began to bore my so easily bored lolita, and, having a childish lack of sympathy for other peoples whims, she would insult me and my desire to have her caress me while blueeyed little brunettes in blue shorts, copperheads in green boleros, and blurred boyish blondes in faded slacks passed by in the sun.         as a sort of compromise, i freely advocated whenever and wherever possible the use of swimming pools with other girlchildren. she adored brilliant water and was a remarkably smart diver. comfortably robed, i would settle down in the rich postmeridian shade after my own demure dip, and there i would sit, with a dummy book or a bag of bonbons, or both, or nothing but my tingling glands, and watch her gambol, rubbercapped, bepearled, smoothly tanned, as glad as an ad, in her trimfitted satin pants and shirred bra. pubescent sweetheart how smugly would i marvel that she was mine, mine, mine, and revise the recent matitudinal swoon to the moan of the mourning doves, and devise the late afternoon one, and slitting my sunspeared eyes, compare lolita to whatever other nymphets parsimonious chance collected around her for my anthological delectation and judgment and today, putting my hand on my ailing heart, i really do not think that any of them ever surpassed her in desirability, or if they did, it was so two or three times at the most, in a certain light, with certain perfumes blended in the aironce in the hopeless case of a pale spanish child, the daughter of a heavyjawed nobleman, and another time          mais je divague.         naturally, i had to be always wary, fully realizing, in my lucid jealousy, the danger of those dazzling romps. i had only to turn away for a momentto walk, say, a few steps in order to see if our cabin was at last ready after the morning change of linenand lo and behold, upon returning, i would find the former,          les yeux perdus,dipping and kicking her longtoed feet in the water on the stone edge of which she lolled, while, on either side of her, there crouched a          brun adolescentwhom her russet beauty and the quicksilver in the baby folds of her stomach were sure to cause to          se tordreoh baudelairein recurrent dreams for months to come.         i tried to teach her to play tennis so we might have more amusements in common but although i had been a good player in my prime, i proved to be hopeless as a teacher and so, in california, i got her to take a number of very expensive lessons with a famous coach, a husky, wrinkled oldtimer, with a harem of ball boys he looked an awful wreck off the court, but now and then, when, in the course of a lesson, to keep up the exchange, he would put out as it were an exquisite spring blossom of a stroke and twang the ball back to his pupil, that divine delicacy of absolute power made me recall that, thirty years before, i had seen          himin cannes demolish the great gobbert until she began taking those lessons, i thought she would never learn the game. on this or that hotel court i would drill lo, and try to relive the days when in a hot gale, a daze of dust, and queer lassitude, i fed ball after ball to gay, innocent, elegant annabel gleam of bracelet, pleated white skirt, black velvet hair band. with every word of persistent advice i would only augment los sullen fury. to our games, oddly enough, she preferredat least, before we reached californiaformless pat ball approximationsmore ball hunting than actual playwith a wispy, weak, wonderfully pretty in an          ange gaucheway coeval. a helpful spectator, i would go up to that other child, and inhale her faint musky fragrance as i touched her forearm and held her knobby wrist, and push this way or that her cool thigh to show her the backhand stance. in the meantime, lo, bending forward, would let her sunnybrown curls hang forward as she stuck her racket, like a cripples stick, into the ground and emitted a tremendous ugh of disgust at my intrusion. i would leave them to their game and look on, comparing their bodies in motion, a silk scarf round my throat this was in south arizona, i thinkand the days had a lazy lining warmth, and awkward lo would slash at the ball and miss it, and curse, and send a simulacrum of a serve into the net, and show the wet glistening young down of her armpit as she brandished her racket in despair, and her even more insipid partner would dutifully rush out after every ball, and retrieve none but both were enjoying themselves beautifully, and in clear ringing tones kept the exact score of their ineptitudes all the time.         one day, i remember, i offered to bring them cold drinks from the hotel, and went up the gravel path, and came back with two tall glasses of pineapple juice, soda and ice and then a sudden void within my chest made me stop as i saw that the tennis court was deserted. i stooped to set down the glasses on a bench and for some reason, with a kind of icy vividness, saw charlottes face in death, and i glanced around, and noticed lo in white shorts receding through the speckled shadow of a garden path in the company of a tall man who carried two tennis rackets. i sprang after them, but as i was crashing through the shrubbery, i saw, in an alternate vision, as if lifes course constantly branched, lo, in slacks, and her companion, in shorts, trudging up and down a small weedy area, and beating bushes with their rackets in listless search for their last lost ball.         i itemize these sunny nothings mainly to prove to my judges that i did everything in my power to give my lolita a really good time. how charming it was to see her, a child herself, showing another child some of her few accomplishments, such as for example a special way of jumping rope. with her right hand holding her left arm behind her untanned back, the lesser nymphet, a diaphanous darling, would be all eyes, as the pavonine sun was all eyes on the gravel under the flowering trees, while in the midst of that oculate paradise, my freckled and raffish lass skipped, repeating the movements of so many others i had gloated over on the sunshot, watered, dampsmelling sidewalks and ramparts of ancient europe. presently, she would hand the rope back to her little spanish friend, and watch in her turn the repeated lesson, and brush away the hair from her brow, and fold her arms, and step on one toe with the other, or drop her hands loosely upon her still unflared hips, and i would satisfy myself that the damned staff had at last finished cleaning up our cottage whereupon, flashing a smile to the shy, darkhaired page girl of my princess and thrusting my fatherly fingers deep into los hair from behind, and then gently but firmly clasping them around the nape of her neck, i would lead my reluctant pet to our small home for a quick connection before dinner.         whose cat has scratched poor you a fullblown fleshy handsome woman of the repulsive type to which i was particularly attractive might ask me at the lodge, during a table dhote dinner followed by dancing promised to lo. this was one of the reasons why i tried to keep as far away from people as possible, while lo, on the other hand, would do her utmost to draw as many potential witnesses into her orbit as she could.         she would be, figuratively speaking wagging her tiny tail, her whole behind in fact as little bitches dowhile some grinning stranger accosted us and began a bright conversation with a comparative study of license plates. long way from home inquisitive parents, in order to pump lo about me, would suggest her going to a movie with their children. we had some close shaves. the waterfall nuisance pursued me of course in all our caravansaries. but i never realized how wafery their wall substance was until one evening, after i had loved too loudly, a neighbors masculine cough filled the pause as clearly as mine would have done and next morning as i was having breakfast at the milk bar lo was a late sleeper, and i liked to bring her a pot of hot coffee in bed, my neighbor of the eve, an elderly fool wearing plain glasses on his long virtuous nose and a convention badge on his lapel, somehow managed to rig up a conversation with me, in the course of which he inquired, if my missus was like his missus a rather reluctant getupper when not on the farm and had not the hideous danger i was skirting almost suffocated me, i might have enjoyed the odd look of surprise on his thinlipped weatherbeaten face when i drily answered, as i slithered off my stool, that i was thank god a widower.         how sweet it was to bring that coffee to her, and then deny it until she had done her morning duty. and i was such a thoughtful friend, such a passionate father, such a good pediatrician, attending to all the wants of my little auburn brunettes body my only grudge against nature was that i could not turn my lolita inside out and apply voracious lips to her young matrix, her unknown heart, her nacreous liver, the seagrapes of her lungs, her comely twin kidneys. on especially tropical afternoons, in the sticky closeness of the siesta, i liked the cool feel of armchair leather against my massive nakedness as i held her in my lap. there she would be, a typical kid picking her nose while engrossed in the lighter sections of a newspaper, as indifferent to my ecstasy as if it were something she had sat upon, a shoe, a doll, the handle of a tennis racket, and was too indolent to remove. her eyes would follow the adventures of her favorite strip characters there was one welldrawn sloppy bobbysoxer, with high cheekbones and angular gestures, that i was not above enjoying myself she studied the photographic results of headon collisions she never doubted the reality of place, time, and circumstance alleged to match the publicity pictures of nakedthighed beauties and she was curiously fascinated by the photographs of local brides, some in full wedding apparel, holding bouquets and wearing glasses.         a fly would settle and walk in the vicinity of her navel or explore her tender pale areolas. she tried to catch it in her fist charlottes method and then would turn to the column lets explore your mind.         lets explore your mind. would sex crimes be reduced if children obeyed a few donts dont play around public toilets. dont take candy or rides from strangers. if picked up, mark down the license of the car.         and the brand of the candy, i volunteered.         she went on, her cheek recedent against mine pursuant and this was a good day, mark, o reader         if you dont have a pencil, but are old enough to read         we, i quipquoted, medieval mariners, have placed in this bottle         if, she repeated, you dont have a pencil, but are old enough to read and writethis is what the guy means, isnt it, you dopescratch the number somehow on the roadside.         with your little claws, lolita.         she had entered my world, umber and black humberland, with rash curiosity she surveyed it with a shrug of amused distaste and it seemed to me now that she was ready to turn away from it with something akin to plain repulsion. never did she vibrate under my touch, and a strident what dyou think you are doing was all i got for my pains. to the wonderland i had to offer, my fool preferred the corniest movies, the most cloying fudge. to think that between a hamburger and a humburger, she wouldinvariably, with icy precisionplump for the former. there is nothing more atrociously cruel than an adored child. did i mention the name of that milk bar i visited a moment ago it was, of all things, the frigid queen. smiling a little sadly, i dubbed her my frigid princess. she did not see the wistful joke.         oh, d not scowl at me, reader, i do not intend to convey the impressin that i did not manage to be happy. readeer must understand that in the possession and thralldom of a nymphet the enchanted traveler stands, as it were,          beyond happiness.for there is no other bliss on earth comparable to that of fondling a nymphet. it is          hors         concours, that bliss, it belongs to another class, another plane of sensitivity. despite our tiffs, despite her nastiness, despite all the fuss and faces she made, and the vulgarity, and the danger, and the horrible hopelessness of it all, i still dwelled deep in my elected paradisea paradise whose skies were the color of hellflamesbut still a paradise.         the able psychiatrist who studies my caseand whom by now dr. humbert has plunged, i trust, into a state of leporine fascinationis no doubt anxious to have me take lolita to the seaside and have me find there, at last, the gratification of a lifetime urge, and release from the subconscious obsession of an incomplete childhood romance with the initial little miss lee.         well, comrade, let me tell you that i          didlook for a beach, though i also have to confess that by the time we reached its mirage of gray water, so many delights had already been granted me by my traveling companion that the search for a kingdom by the sea, a sublimated riviera, or whatnot, far from being the impulse of the subconscious, had become the rational pursuit of a purely theoretical thrill. the angels knew it, and arranged things accordingly. a visit to a plausible cove on the atlantic side was completely messed up by foul weather. a thick damp sky, muddy waves, a sense of boundless but somehow matteroffact mistwhat could be further removed from the crisp charm, the sapphire occasion and rosy contingency of my riviera romance a couple of semitropical beaches on the gulf, though bright enough, were starred and spattered by venomous beasties and swept by hurricane winds. finally, on a californian beach, facing the phantom of the pacific, i hit upon some rather perverse privacy in a kind of cave whence you could hear the shrikes of a lot of girl scouts taking their first surf bath on a separate part of the beach, behind rotting trees but the fog was like a wet blanket, and the sand was gritty and clammy, and lo was all gooseflesh and grit, and for the first time in my life i had as little desire for her as for a manatee. perhaps, my learned readers may perk up if i tell them that even had we discovered a piece of sympathetic seaside somewhere, it would have come too late, since my real liberation had occurred much earlier at the moment, in point of fact, when annabel haze, alias dolores lee, alias loleeta, had appeared tome, golden and brown, kneeling, looking up, on that shoddy veranda, in a kind of fictitious, dishonest, but eminently satisfactory seaside arrangement although there was nothing but a secondrate lake in the neighborhood..         so much for those special sensations, influence, if not actually brought about, by the tenets of modern psychiatry. consequently, i turned awayi headed my lolita awayfrom beaches which were either too bleak when lone, or too populous when ablaze. however, in recollection, i suppose, of my hopeless hauntings of public parks in europe, i was still keenly interested in outdoor activities and desirous of finding suitable playgrounds in the open where i had suffered such shameful privations. here, too, i was to be thwarted. the disappointment i must now register as i gently grade my story into an expression of the continuous risk and dread that ran through my bliss should in no wise reflect on the lyrical, epic, tragic buit never arcadian american wilds. they are beautiful, heartrendingly beautiful, those wilds, with a quality of wideeyed, unsung, innocent surrender that my lacquered, toybright swiss villages and exhaustively lauded alps no longer possess. innumerable lovers have clipped and kissed on the trim turf of oldwould mountainsides, on the innerspring moss, by a handy, hygienic rill, on rustic benches under the initialed oaks, and in so many          cabanesin so many beech forests. but in the wilds of america the openair lover will not find it easy to indulge in the most ancient of all crimes and pastimes. poisonous plants burn his sweethearts buttocks, nameless insects sting his sharp items of the forest floor prick his knees, insects hers and all around there abides a sustained rustle of potential snakes          que disje, of semiextinct dragonswhile the crablike seeds of ferocious flowers cling, in a hideous green crust, to gartered black sock and sloppy white sock alike.         i am exaggerating a little. one summer noon, just below timberline, where heavenlyhued blossoms that i would fain call larkspur crowded all along a purly moutain brook, we did find, lolita and i, a secluded romantic spot, a hundred feet or so above the pass where we had left our car. the slope seemed untrodden. a last panting pine was taking a wellearned breather on the rock it had reached. a marmot whistled at us and withdrew. beneath the laprobe i had spread fo lor, dryflowers crepitated softly. venus came and went. the jagged cliff crowning the upper talus and a tangle of shrugs growing below us seemed to offer us protection from sun and man alike. alas, i had not reckoned with a faint side trail that curled up in cagey fashion among the shrubs and rocks a few feet from us.         it was then that we came close to detection than ever before, and no wonder the experience curbed forever my yearning for rural amours.         i remember the operation was over, all over, and she was weeping in my armsa salutory storm of sobs after one of the fits of moodiness that had become so frequent with her in the course of that otherwise admirable year i had just retracted some silly promise she had forced me to make in a moment of blind impatient passion, and thee she was sprawling and sobbing, and pinching my caressing hand, and i was laughing happily, and the atrocious, unbelievable, unbearable, and, i suspect, eternal horror that i know          nowwas still but a dot of blackness in the blue of my bliss and so we lay, when with one of those jolts that have ended by knocking my poor heart out of its groove, i met the unblinking dark eyes of two strange and beautiful children, faunlet and nymphet, whom their identical flat dark hair and bloodless cheeks proclaimed siblings if not twins. they stood crouching and gaping at us, both in blue playsuits, blending with the mountain blossoms. i plucked at the laprobe for desperate concealmentand within the same instant, something that looked like a polkadotted pushball among the undergrowth a few paces away, went into a turning motion which was transformed into the gradually rising figure of a stout lady with a ravenblack bob, who automatically added a wild lily to her bouquet, while staring over her shoulder at us from behind her lovely carved bluestone children.         now that i have an altogether different mess on my conscience, i know that i am a courageous man, but in those days i was not aware of it, and i remember being surprised by my own coolness. with the quiet murmured order one gives a sweatstained distracted cringing trained animal even in the worst of plights what mad hope or hate makes the young beasts flanks pulsate, what black stars pierce the heart of the tamer, i made lo get up, and we decorously walked, and then indecorously scuttled down to the car. behind it a nifty station wagon was parked, and a handsome assyrian with q little blueblack beard,          un         monsieur trs bien, in silk shirt and magenta slacks, presumably the corpulent botanists husband, was gravely taking the picture of a signboard giving the altitude of the pass. it was well over , feet and i was quite out of breath and with a scrunch and a skid we drove off, lo still struggling with her clothes and swearing at me in language that i never dreamed little girls could know, let alone use.         there were other unpleasant incidents. there was the movie theatre once, for example. lo at the time still had for the cinema a veritable passion it was to decline into tepid condescension during her second high school year. we took in, voluptuously and indiscriminately, oh, i dont know, one hundred and fifty or two hundred programs during that one year, and during some of the denser periods of moviegoing we saw many of the newsreels up to halfadozen times since the same weekly one went with different main pictures and pursued us from town to town. her favorite kinds were, in this order musicals, underworlders, westerners. in the first, real singers and dancers had unreal stage careers in an essentially griefproof sphere of existence wherefrom death and truth were banned, and where, at the end, whitehaired, dewyeyed, technically deathless, the initially reluctant father of a showcrazy girl always finished by applauding her apotheosis on fabulous broadway. the underworld was a world apart there, heroic newspapermen were tortured, telephone bills ran to billions, and, in a robust atmosphere of incompetent marksmanship, villains were chased through sewers and storehouses by pathologically fearless cops i was to give them less exercise. finally there was the mahogany landscape, the floridfaced, blueeyed roughriders, the prim pretty schoolteacher arriving in roaring gulch, the rearing horse, the spectacular stampede, the pistol thrust through the shivered windowpane, the stupendous fist fight, the crashing mountain of dusty oldfashioned furniture, the table used as a weapon, the timely somersault, the pinned hand still groping for the dropped bowie knife, the grunt, the sweet crash of fist against chin, the kick in the belly, the flying tackle and immediately after a plethora of pain that would have hospitalized a hercules i should know by now, nothing to show but the rather becoming bruise on the bronzed cheek of the warmedup hero embracing his gorgeous frontier bride. i remember one matinee in a small airless theatre crammed with children and reeking with the hot breath of popcorn. the moon was yellow above the neckerchiefed crooner, and his finger was on his strumstring, and his foot was on a pine log, and i had innocently encircled los shoulder and approached my jawbone to her temple, when two harpies behind us started muttering the queerest thingsi do not know if i understood aright, but what i thought i did, made me withdraw my gentle hand, and of course the rest of the show was fog to me.         another jolt i remember is connected with a little burg we were traversing at night, during our return journey. some twenty miles earlier i had happened to tell her that the day school she would attend at beardsley was a rather highclass, noncoeducational one, with no modern nonsense, whereupon lo treated me to one of those furious harangues of hers where entreaty and insult, selfassertion and double talk, vicious vulgarity and childish despair, were interwoven in an exasperating semblance of logic which prompted a semblance of explanation from me. enmeshed in her wild words swell chance id be a sap if i took your opinion seriously stinker you cant boss me i despise you and so forth, i drove throuth the slumbering town at a fiftymileperhour pace in continuance of my smooth highway swoosh, and a twosome of patrolmen put their spotlight on the car, and told me to pull over. i shushed lo who was automatically raving on. the men peered at her and me with malevolent curiosity. suddenly all dimples, she beamed sweetly at them, as she never did at my orchideous masculinity for, in a sense, my lo was even more scared of the law than iand when the kind officers pardoned us and servilely we crawled on, her eyelids closed and fluttered as she mimicked limp prostration.         at this point i have a curious confession to make. you will laughbut really and truly i somehow never managed to find out quite exactly what the legal situation was. i do not know it yet. oh, i have learned a few odds and ends. alabama prohibits a guardian from changing the wards residence without an order of the court minnesota, to whom i take off my hat, provides that when a relative assumes permanent care and custody of any child under fourteen, the authority of a court does not come into play. query is the stepfather of a gaspingly adorable pubescent pet, a stepfather of only one months standing, a neurotic widower of mature years and small but independent means, with the parapets of europe, a divorce and a few madhouses behind him, is he to be considered a relative, and thus a natural guardian and if not, must i, and could i reasonably dare notify some welfare board and file a petition how do you file a petition, and have a courts agent investigate meek, fishy me and dangerous dolores haze the many books on marriage, rape, adoption and so on, that i guiltily consulted at the public libraries of big and small towns, told me nothing beyond darkly insinuating that the state is the superguardian of minor children. pilvin and zapel, if i remember their names right, in an impressive volume on the legal side of marriage, completely ignored stepfathers with motherless girls on their hands and knees. my best friend, a social service monographchicago, , which was dug out for me at great pains form a dusty storage recess by an innocent old spinster, said there is no principle that every minor must have a guardian the court is passive and enters the fray only when the childs situation becomes conspicuously perilous. a guardian, i concluded, was appointed only when he expressed his solemn and formal desire but months might elapse before he was given notice to appear at a hearing and grow his pair of gray wings, and in the meantime the fair demon child was legally left to her own devices which, after all, was the case of dolores haze. then came the hearing. a few questions from the bench, a few reassuring answers from the attorney, a smile, a nod, a light drizzle outside, and the appointment was made. and still i dared not. keep away, be a mouse, curl up in yourhole. courts became extravagantly active only when there was some monetary question involved two greedy guardians, a robbed orphan, a third, still greedier, party. but here all was in perfect order, and inventory had been made, and her mothers small property was waiting untouched for dolores haze to grow up. the best policy seemed to be to refrain from any application. or would some busybody, some humane society, butt in if i kept          tooquiet         friend farlow, who was a lawyer of sorts and ought to have been able to give me some solid advice, was too much occupied with jeans cancer to do anything more than what he had promisednamely, to look after chrlottes meager estate while i recovered very gradually from the shock of her death. i had conditioned him into believing dolores was my natural child, and so could not expect him to bother his head about the situation. i am, as the reader must have gathered by now, a poor businessman but neither ignorance nor indolence should have prevented me from seeking professional advice elsewhere. what stopped me ws the awful feeling that if i meddled with fate in any way and tried to rationalize her fantastic gift, that gift would be snatched away like that palace on the mountain top in the oriental tale which vanished whenever a prospective owner asked its custodian how come a strip of sunset sky was clearly visible from afar between black rock and foundation.         i decided that at beardsley the site of bearsley college for women i would have access to works of reference that i had not yet been able to study, such as woerners treatise on the american law of guardianship and certain united states childrens bureau publications. i also decided that anything was better for lo than the demoralizing idleness in which she lived. i could persuade her to do so many thingstheir list mnight stupefy a professional educator but no matter how i pleaded or stormed, i could never make her read any other book than the soclled comic books or stories in magazines for american females. any literature a peg higher smacked to her of school, and though theoretically willing to enjoy          a girl of the limberlostor the          arabian nights, or          little women, she was quite sure she would not fritter away her vacation on such highbrow reading matter.         i now think it was a great mistake to move east again and have her go to that private school in beardsley, instead of somehow scrambling across the mexican border while the scrambling was good so as to lie low for a couple of years in subtropical bliss until i could safely marry my little creole for i must confess that depending on the conditin of my glands and ganglia, i could switch in the course of the same day from one pole of insanity to the otherfrom the thought that around  i would have to get rid somehow of a difficult adolescent whose magic nymphage had evaporatedto the thought that with patience and lucki might have her produce eventually a nymphet with my blood in her exquisite veins, a lolita the second, who would be eight or nine around , when i would still be          dans la force de lge indeed, the telescopy of my mind, or unmind, was strong enough to distinguish in the remoteness of time a          vieillard encore vertor was it green rotbizarre, tender, salivating dr. humbert, practicing on supremely lovely lolita the third the art of being a granddad.         in the days of that wild journey of ours, i doubted not that as father to lolita the first i was a ridiculous failure. i did my best i read and reread a book with the unintentionally biblical title          know your own daughter, which i got at the same store where i bought lo, for her thirteenth birthday, a de luxe volume with commercially beautiful illustrations, of andersens          the little mermaid. but even at our very best moments, when we sat reading on a rainy day los glance skipping from the window to her wrist watch and back again, or had a quiet hearty meal in a crowded diner, or played a childish game of cards, or went shopping, or silently stared, with other motorists and their children, at some smashed, bloodbespattered car with a young womans shoe in the ditch lo, as we drove on that was the exact type of moccasin i was trying to describe to that jerk in the store on all those random occasions, i seemed to myself as implausible a father as she seemed to be a daughter. was, perhaps, guilty locomotion instrumental in vitiating our powers of impersonation would improvement be forthcoming with a fixed domicile and a routine schoolgirls day         in my choice of beardsley i was guided not only by the fact of there being a comparatively sedate school for girls located there, but also by the presence of the womens college. in my desire to get myself          cas,to attach myself somehow to some patterned surface which my stripes would blend with, i thought of a man i knew in the department of french at beardsley college he was good enough to use my textbook in his classes and had attempted to get me over once to deliver a lecture. i had no intention of doing so, since, as i have once remarked in the course of these confessions, there are few physiques i loathe more than the heavy lowslung pelvis, thick calves and deplorable complexion of the average coed in whom i see, maybe, the coffin of coarse female flesh within which my nymphets are buried alive but i did crave for a label, a background, and a simulacrum, and, as presently will become clear, there was a reason, a rather zany reason, why old gaston godins company would be particularly safe.         finally, there was the money question. my income was cracking under the strain of our joyride. true, i clung to the cheaper motor courts but every now and then, there would be a loud hotel de luxe, or a pretentious dude ranch, to mutilate our budget staggering sums, moreover, were expended on sightseeing and los clothes, and the old haze bus, although a still vigorous and very devoted machine, necessitated numerous minor and major repairs. in one of our strip maps that has happened to survive among the papers which the authorities have so kindly allowed me to use for the purpose of writing my statement, i find some jottings that help me compute the following. during that extravagant year , august to august, lodgings and food cost us arround , dollars gas, oil and repairs, ,, and various extras almost as much so that during about  days of actual motion we covered about , miles plus some  days of interpolated standstills, this modest          rentierspent around , dollars, or better say , because, unpractical as i am, i have surely forgotten a number of items.         and so we rolled east, i more devastated than braced with the satisfaction of my passion, and she glowing with health, her biiliac garland still as brief as a lads, although she had added two inches to her stature and eight pounds to her weight. we had been everywhere. we had really seen nothing. and i catch myself thinking that our long journey had only defiled with a sinuous trail of slime the lovely, trustful, dreamy, enormous country that by then, in retrospect, was no more to us than a collection of dogeared maps, ruined tour books, old tires, and her sobs in the nightevery night, every nightthe moment i feigned sleep.                                             when, through decorations of light and shade, we drove to  thayer street, a grave little lad met us with the keys and a note from gaston who had rented the house for us. my lo, without granting her new surroundings one glance, unseeingly turned on the radio to which instinct led her and lay down on the living room sofa with a batch of old magazines which in the same precise and blind manner she landed by dipping her hand into the nether anatomy of a lamp table.         i really did not mind where to dwell provided i could lock my lolita up somewhere but i had, i suppose, in the course of my correspondence with vague gaston, vaguely visualized a house of ivied brick. actually the place bore a dejected resemblance to the haze home a mere  distant it was the same sort of dull gray frame affair with a shingled roof and dull green drill awnings and the rooms, though smaller and furnished in a more consistent plushandplate style, were arranged in much the same order. my study turned out to be, however, a much larger room, lined from floor to ceiling with some two thousand books on chemistry which my landlord on sabbatical leave for the time being taught at beardsley college.         i had hoped beardsley school for girls, an expensive day school, with lunch thrown in and a glamorous gymnasium, would, while cultivating all those young bodies, provide some formal education for their minds as well. gaston godin, who was seldom right in his judgment of american habitus, had warned me that the institution might turn out to be one of those where girls are taught, as he put it with a foreigners love for such things not to spell very well, but to smell very well. i dont think they achieved even that.         at my first interview with headmistress pratt, she approved of my childs nice blue eyes blue lolita and of my own friendship with that french genius a genius gastonand then, having turned dolly over to a miss cormorant, she wrinkled her brow in a kind of          recueillementand said         we are not so much concerned, mr. humbird, with having our students become bookworms or be able to reel off all the capitals of europe which nobody knows anyway, or learn by heart the dates of forgotten battles. what we are concerned with is the adjustment of the child to group life. this is why we stress the four ds dramatics, dance, debating and dating. we are confronted by certain facts. your delightful dolly will presently enter an age groupwhere dates, dating, date dress, date book, date etiquette, mean as much to her as, say, business, business connections, business success, mean to you, or as much as smiling the happiness of my girls means to me. dorothy humbird is already involved in a whole system of social life which consists, whether we like ti or not, of hotdog stands, corner drugstores, malts and cokes, movies, squaredancing, blanket parties on beaches, and even hairfixing parties naturally at beardsley school we disapprove of some of these activities and we rechannel others into more constructive directions. but we do try to turn our backs on the fog and squarely face the sunshine. to put it briefly, while adopting certain teaching techniques, we are more interested in communication than in composition. that is, with due respect to shakespeare and others, we want our girls to          communicatefreely with the live world around them rather than plunge into musty old books. we are still groping perhaps, but we grope intelligently, like a gynecologist feeling a tumor. we thing, dr. humburg, in organissmal and organizational terms. we have done away with the mass or irrelevant topics that have traditionally been presented to young girls, leaving no place, in former days, for the knowledges and the skills, and the attitudes they will need in managing their lives andas the cynic might addthe lives of their husbands. mr. humberson, let us put it this way the position of a star is important, but the most practical spot for an icebox in the kitchen may be even more important to the budding housewife. you say that all you expect a child to obtain from school is a sound education. but what do we mean by education in the old days it was in the main a verbal phenomenon i mean, you could have a child learn by heart a good encyclopedia and he or she would know as much as or more than a school could offer. dr. hummer, do you realize that for the modern preadolescent child, medieval dates are of less vital value than weekend ones twinkleto repeat a pun that i heard the beardsley college psychoanalyst permit herself the other day. we live not only in a world of thughts, but also in a world of things. wrds without experience are meaningless. what on earth can dorothy hummerson care for greece and the orient with their harems and slaves         this program rather appalled me, but i spoke to two intelligent ladies who had been connected with the school, and they affirmed that the girls did quite a bit of sound reading and that the communication line was more or less ballyhoo aimed at giving oldfashioned beardsley school a financially remunerative modern touch, though actually it remained as prim as a prawn.         another reason attracting me to that particular school may sweem funny to some readers, but it was very important to me, for that is the way i am made. across our street, exactly in front of our house, there was, i noticed, a gap of weedy wasteland, with some colorful bushes and a pile of bricks and a few scattered planks, and the foam of shabby mauve and chrome autumn roadside flowers and through that gap you could see a shimmery section of school rd., running parallel to our thayer st., and immediately beyond that, the playground of the school apart from the psychological comfort this general arrangement should afford me by keeping dollys day adjacent to mine, i immediately foresaw the pleasure i would have in distinguishing from my studybedroom, by means of powerful binoculars, the statistically inevitable percentage of nymphets among the other girl children playing around dolly during recess unfortunately, on the very first day of school, workmen arrived and put up a fence some way down the gap, and in no time a construction of tawny wood maliciously arose beyond that fence utterly blocking my magic vista and as soon as they had erected a sufficient amount of material to spoil everything, those absurd builders suspended their work and never appeared again.                                             in a street called thayer street, in the residential green, fawn, and golden of a mellow academic townlet, one was bound to have a few amiable finedayers yelping at you. i prided myself on the exact temperature of my relations with them never rude, always aloof. my westdoor neighbor, who might have been a businessman or a college teacher, or both, would speak to me once in a while as he barbered some late garden blooms or watered his car, or, at a later date, defrosted his driveway i dont mind if these verbs are all wrong, but my brief grunts, just sufficeiently articulate to sound like conventional assents or interrogative pausefillers, precluded any evolution toward chumminess. of the two houses flanking the bit of scrubby waste opposite, one was closed, and the other contained two professors of english, tweedy and shorthaired miss lester and fadedly feminine miss fabian, whose only subject of brief sidewalk conversation with me was god bless their tact the young loveliness of my daughter and the nave charm of gaston godin. my eastdoor neighbor was by far the most dangerous one, a sharpnosed stock character whose late brother had been attached to the college as superintendent of buildings and grounds. i remember her waylaying dolly, while i stood at the living room window, feverishly awaiting my darlings return from school. the odious spinster, trying to conceal her morbid inquisitiveness under a mask of dulcet goodwill, stood leaning on her slim umbrella the sleet had just stopped, a cold wet sun had sidled out, and dolly, her brown coat open despite the raw weather, her structural heap of books pressed against her stomach, her knees showing pink above her clumsy wellingtons, a sheepish frightened slittle smile flitting over and off her snubnosed face, whichowing perhaps to the pale wintry lightlooked almost plain, in a rustic, german,          mgdleinlike way, as she stood there and dealt with miss easts questions and where is your mother, my dear and what is your poor fathers occupation and where did you love before another time the loathsome creature accosted me with a welcoming whinebut i evaded her and a few days later there came from her a note in a bluemargined envelope, a nice mixture of poison and treacle, suggesting dolly come over on a sunday and curl up in a chair to look through the loads of beautiful books my dear mother gave me when i was a child, instead of having the radio on at full blast till all hours of the night.         i had also to be careful in regard to a mrs. holigan, a charwoman and cook of sorts whom i had inherited with the vacuum cleaner from the previous tenants. dolly got lunch at school, so that this was no trouble, and i had become adept at providing her with a big breakfast and warming up the dinner that mrs. holigan prepared before leaving. that kindly and harmless woman had, thank god, a rather bleary eye that missed details, and i had become a great expert in bedmaking but still i was continuously obsessed by the feeling that some fatal stain had been left somewhere, or that, on the rare occasions where holigans presence happened to coincide with los, simple lo might succumb to buxom sympathy in the course of a cozy kitchen chat. i often felt we lived in a lighted house of glass, and any moment some thinlipped parchment face would peer through a carelessly unshaded window to obtain a free glimpse of things that the most jaded          voyeurwould have paid a small fortune to watch.                                             a word about gaston godin. the main reason why i enjoyedor at least tolerated with reliefhis company was the spell of absolute security that his ample person cast on my secret. not that he knew it i had no special reason to confide in him, and he was much too selfcentered and abstract to notice or suspect anything that might lead to a frank question on his part and a frank answer on mine. he spoke well of me to beardsleyans, he was my good herald. had he discovered          mes gotsand lolitas status, it would have interested him only insofar as throwing some light on the simplicity of my attitude towards          him, which attitude was as free of polite strain as it was of ribald allusions for despite his colorless mind and dim memory, he was perhaps aware that i knew more about him than the burghers of beardsley did. he was a flabby, doughfaced, melancholy bachelor tapering upward to a pair of narrow, not quite level shoulders and a conical pearhead which had sleek black hair on one side and only a few plastered wisps on the other. but the lower part of his body was enormous, and he ambulated with a curious elephantine stealth by means of phenomentally stout legs. he always woer black, even his tie was black he seldom bathed his english was a burlesque. and, nonetheless, everybody considered him to be a supremely lovable, lovably freakish fellow neighbors pampered him he knew by name all the small boys in our vicinity he lived a few blocks away from meand had some of them clean his sidewalk and burn leaves in his back yard, and bring wood from his shed, and even perform simple chores about the house, and he would feed them fancy chocolates, with          realliqueurs insidein the privacy of an orientally furnished den in his basement, with amusing daggers and pistols arrayed on the moldy, rugadorned walls among the camouflaged hotwater pipes. upstairs he had a studiohe painted a little, the old fraud. he had decorated its sloping wall it was really not more than a garret with large photographs of pensive andr gide, tchakovsky, norman douglas, two other wellknown english writers, nijinsky all thighs and fig leaves, harold d. doublename a mistyeyed leftwing professor at a midwesten university and marcel proust. all these poor people seemed about to fall on you from their inclined plane. he had also an album with snapshots of all the jackies and dickies of the neighborhood, and when i happened to thumb through it and make some casual remark, gaston would purse his fat lips and murmur with a wistful pout           oui, ils sont gentils. his brown eyes would roam around the various sentimental and artistic bricabrac present, and his own banal          toilesthe conventionally primitive eyes, sliced guitars, blue nipples and geometrical designs of the day, and with a vague gesture toward a painted wooden bowl or veined vase, he would say           prenez donc une de ces poires.         la bonne dame den face men offre plus que je nen peux savourer. or           mississe taille lore vient de me donner ces dahlias, belles fleurs que jexcre. somber, sad, full of worldweariness.         for obvious reasons, i preferred myhouse to his for the games of chess we had two or three times weekly. he looked like some old battered idol as he sat with his pudgy hands in his lap and stared at the board as if it were a corpse. wheezing he would mediate for ten minutesthen make a losing move. or the good man, after even more thought, might utter          au roiwith a slow olddog woof that had a gargling sound at the back of it which made his jowls wabble and then he would lift his circumflex eyebrows with a deep sigh as i pointed out to him that he was in check himself.         sometimes, from where we sat in my cold study i could hear los bare feet practicing dance techniques in the living room downstairs but gastons outgoing senses were comfortably dulled, and he remained unaware of those naked rhythmsandone, andtwo, andone, andtwo, weight transferred on a straight right leg, leg up and out to the side, andone, andtwo, and only when she started jumping, opening her legs at the height of the jump, and flexing one leg, and extending the other, and flying, and landing on her toesonly then did my pale, pompous, morose opponent rub his head or cheek a if confusing those distant thuds with the awful stabs of my formidable queen.         sometimes lola would slouch in while we pondered the boardand it was every time a treat to see gaston, his elephant eye still fixed on his pieces, ceremoniously rise to shake hands with her, and forthwith release her limp fingers, and without looking once at her, descend again into his chair to topple into the trap i had laid for him. one day around christmas, after i had not seen him for a fortnight or so, he asked me           et toutes vos fillettes, elles vont bien          from which it became evident to me that he had multiplied my unique lolita by the number of sartorial categories his downcast moody eye had glimpsed during a whole series of her appearances blue jeans, a skirt, shorts, a quilted robe.         i am loath to dwell so long on the poor fellow sadly enough, a year later, during a voyage to europe, from which he did not return, he got involved in a          sale histoire, in napes of all places. i would have hardly alluded to him at all had not his beardsley existence had such a queer bearing on my case. i need him for my defense. there he was devoid of any talent whatsoever, a mediocre teacher, a worthless scholar, a glum repulsive fat old invert, highly contemptuous of the american way of life, triumphantly ignorant of the english languagethere he was in priggish new england, crooned over by the old and caressed by the youngoh, having a grand time and fooling everybody and here was i.                                             i am now faced with the distasteful task of recording a definite drop in lolitas morals. if her share in the ardors she kindled had never amounted to much, neither had pure lucre ever come to the fore. but i was weak, i was not wise, my schoolgirl nymphet had me in thrall. with the human element dwindling, the passion, the tenderness, and the torture only increased and of this she took advantage.         her weekly allowance, paid to her under condition she fulfill her basic obligations, was twentyone cents at the start of the beardsley eraand went up to one dollar five before its end. this was a more than generous arrangement seeing she constantly received from me all kinds of small presents and had for the asking any sweetmeat or movie under the moonalthough, of course, i might fondly demand an additional kiss, or even a whole collection of assorted caresses, when i knew she coveted very badly some item of juvenile amusement. she was, however, not easy to deal with. only very listlessly did she earn her three penniesor three nickelsper day and she proved to be a cruel negotiator whenever it was in her power to deny me certain lifewrecking, strange, slow paradisal philters without which i could not live more than a few days in a row, and which, because of the very nature of loves languor, i could not obtain by force. knowing the magic and might of her own soft mouth, she managedduring one schoolyearto raise the bonus price of a fancy embrace to three, and even four bucks o reader laugh not, as you imagine me, on the very rack of joy noisily emitting dimes and quarters, and great big silver dollars like some sonorous, jingly and wholly demented machine vomiting riches and in the margin of that leaping epilepsy she would firmly clutch a handful of coins in her little fist, which, anyway, i used to pry open afterwards unless she gave me the slip, scrambling away to hide her loot. and just as every other day i would cruise all around the school area and on comatose feet visit drugstores, and peer into foggy lanes, and listen to receding girl laughter in between my heart throbs and the falling leaves, so every now and then i would burgle her room and scrutinize torn papers in the wastebasket with the painted roses, and look under the pillow of the virginal bed i had just made myself. once i found eight onedollar notes in one of her books fittingly          treasure island, and once a hole in the wall behind whistlers mother yielded as much as twentyfour dollars and some changesay twentyfour sixtywhich i quietly removed, upon which, next day, she accused, to my face, honest mrs. holigan of being a filthy thief. eventually, she lived up to her i.q. by finding a safer hoarding place which i never discovered but by that time i had brought prices down drastically by having her earn the hard and nauseous way permission to participate in the schools theatrical program because what i feared most was not that she might ruin me, but that she might accumulate sufficient cash to run away. i believe the poor fierceeyed child had figured out that with a mere fifty dollars in her urse she might somehow reach broadway or hollywoodor the foul kitchen of a diner help wanted in a dismal exprairie state, with the wind blowing, and the stars blinking, and the cars, and the bars, and the barmen, and everything soiled, torn, dead.                                             i did my best, your honr, to tackele the problem of boys. oh, i used even to read in the beardsley star a socalled column for teens, to find out how to behave                    a word to fathers.           dont frighten away daughters friend. maybe it is a bit hard for you to realize that now the boys are finding her attractive. to you she is still a little girl. to the boys shes charming and fun, lovely and gay. they like her. today you clinch big deals in an exectuvies office, but yesterday you were just highschool jim carrying janes school books. remember dont you want your daughter, now that her turn has come, to be happy in the admiration and company of boys she likes dont you want your daughter, now that her turn has come, to be happy in the admiration and company of boys she likes dont you want them to have wholesome fun together                  wholesome fun good lord                    why not treat the young fellows as guests in your house why not make conversation with them draw them out, make them laugh and feel at ease                  welcome, fellow, to this brdello.                    if she breaks the rules dont explode out loud in front of her partner in crime. let her take the brunt of your displeasure in private. and stop making the boys feel shes the daughter of an old ogre.                  first of all the old ogre drew up a list under absolutely forbidden and another under reluctantly allowed. absolutely forbidden were dates, single or double or triplethe next step being of course mass orgy. she might visit a candy bar with her girl friends, and there gigglechat with occasional young males, while i waited in the car at a discreet distance and i promised her that if her group were invited by a socially acceptable group in butlers academy for boys for their annual ball heavily chaperoned, of course, i might consider the question whether a girl of fourteen can don her first formal a kind of gown that makes thinarmed teenagers look like flamingoes. moreover, i promised her to throw a party a t our house to which she would be allowed to invite her prettier girl friends and the nicer boys she would have met by that time at the butler dance. but i was quite positive that as long as my regime lasted she would never, never be permitted to go with a youngster in rut to a movie, or neck in a car, or go to boygirl parties at the housesof schoolmates, or indulge out of my earshot in boygirl telephone conversations, even if only discussing his relations with a friend of mine.         lo was enraged by all thiscalled me a lousy crook and worseand i would probably have lost my temper had i not soon discovered, to my sweetest relief, that what really angered her was my depriving her not of a specific satisfaction but of a general right. i was impinging, you see, on the conventional program, the stock pastimes, the things that are done, the routie of youth for there is nothing more conservative than a child, especially a girlchild, be she the most auburn and russet, the most mythopoeic nymphet in octobers orchardhaze.         do not misunderstand me. i cannot be absolutely certain that in the course of the winter she did not manage to have, in a casual way, improper contacts with unknown young fellows of course, no matter how closely i controlled her leisure, there would constantly occur unaccountedfor time leaks with overelaborate explanations to stop them up in retrospect of course, my jealousy would constantly catch its jagged claw in the fine fabrics of nymphet falsity but i did definitely feeland can now vouchsafe for the accuracy of my feelingthat there was no reason for serious alarm. i felt that way not because i never once discovered any palpable hard young throat to crush among the masculine mutes that flickered somewhere in the background but because it was to me overwhelmingly obvious a favorite expression with my aunt sybil that all varieties of high school boysfrom the perspiring nincompoop whom holding hands thrills, to the selfsufficient rapist with pustules and a soupedup carequally bored my sophisticated young mistress. all this noise about boys gags me, she had scrawled on the inside of a schoolbook, and underneath, in monas hand mona is due any minute now, there was the sly quip what about rigger due too.         faceless, then, are the chappies i happened to see in her company. there was for instance red sweater who one day, the day we had the first snowsaw her home from the parlor window i observed them talking near our porch. she wre her first cloth coat with a fur collar there was a small brown cap on my favorite hairdothe fringe in front and the swirl at the sides and the natural curls at the backand her dampdark moccasins and white socks were more sloppy than ever. she pressed as usual her books to her chest while speaking or listening, and her feet gestured all the time she would stand on her left instep with her right toe, remove it backward, cross her feet, rock slightly, sketch a few steps, and then start the series all over again. there was windbreaker who talked to her in front of a restaurant one sunday afternoon while his mother and sister attempted to walk me away for a chat i dragged along and looked back at my only love. she had developed more than one conventional mannerism, such as the polite adolescent way of showing one is literally doubled up with laughter by incling ones head, and so as she sensed my call, still feigning helpless merriment, she walked backward a couple of steps, and then faced about, and walked toward me with a fading smile. on the other hand, i greatly likedperhaps because it reminded me of her first unforgettable confessionher trick of sighing oh dear in humorous wistufl submission to fate, or emitting a long noo in a deep almost growling undertone when thye blow of fate had actually fallen. above allsince we are speaking of movement and youthi liked to see her spinning up and down thayer street on her beautiful young bicycle rising on the pedals to work on them lustily, then sinking back in a languid posture while the speed wore itself off and then she would stop at our mailbox and, still astride, would flip through a magazine she found there, and put it back, and press her tongue to one side of her upper lip and push off with her foot, and again sprint through pale shade and sun.         on the whole she seemed to me better adapted to her surroundings than i had hoped she would be when considering my spoiled slavechild and the bangles of demeanor she navely affected the winter before in california. although i could never get used to the constant state of anxiety in which the guilty, the great, the tenderhearted live, i felt i was doing my best in the way of mimicry. as i lay on my narrow studio bed a fter asession of adoration and despair in lolitas cold bedroom, i used to review the concluded day by checking my own image as it prowled rather than passed before the minds red eye. i watched darkandhandsome, not unceltic, probably highchurch, possibly very highchurch, dr. humbert see his daughter off to school i watched him greet with his slow smile and pleasantly arched thick black adeyebrows good mrs. holigan, who smelled of the plague and would head, i knew, for masters gin at the first opportunity. with mr. west, retired executioner or writer of religious tractswho caredi saw neighbor whats his name, i think they are french or swiss, meditate in his frankwindowed study over a typewriter, rather gauntprofiled, an almost hitlerian cowlick on his pale brow. weekends, wearing a welltailored overcoat and brown gloves, professor h. might be seen with his daughter strolling to walton inn famous for its violetribboned china bunnies and chocolate boxes among which you sit and wait for a table for two still filthy with your predecessors crumbs. seen on weekdays, around one p.m. , saluting with dignity arguseyed east while maneuvering the car out of the garage and around the damned evergreens, and down onto the slippery road. raising a cold eye from book to clock in the positively sultry beardsley college library, among bulky young women caught and petrified in the overflow of human knowledge. walking across the campus with the college clergyman, the rev. rigger who also taught bible in beardsley school. somebody told me her mother was a celebrated actress killed in an airplane accident. oh my mistake, i presume. is that so i see. how sad. sublimating her mother, eh slowly pushing my little pram through the labyrinth of the supermarket, in the wake of professor w., also a slowmoving and gentle widower with the eyes of a goat. shoveling the snow in my shirtsleeves, a voluminous black and white muffler around my neck. following with no show of rapacious haste even taking time to wipe my feet on the mat my schoolgirl daughter into the house. taking dolly to the dentistpretty nurse beaming at herold magazines          ne montrez pas vos zhambes. at dinner with dolly in town, mr. edgar h. humbert was seen eating his steak in the continental knifeandfork manner. enjoying, in duplicate, a concert two marblefaced, becalmed frenchmen sitting side by side, with monsieur h. h.s musical little girl on her fathers right, and the musical little boy of professor w. father spending a hygienic evening in providence on monsieur g. g.s left. opening the garage, a square of light that engulfs the car and is extinguished. brightly pajamaed, jerking down the window shade in dollys bedroom. saturday morning, unseen, solemnly weighing the winterbleached lassie in the bathroom. seen and heard sunday morning, no chruchgoer after all, saying dont be too late, to dolly who is bound for the covered court. letting in a queerly observant schoolmate of dollys first time ive seen a man wearing a smoking jacket, sirexcept in movies, of course.                                             her girlfriends, whom i looked forward to meet, proved on the whole disappointing. there was opal something, and linda hall, and avis chapman, and eva rosen, and mona dahl save one, all these names are approximations, of course. opal was a bashful, formless, bespectacled, bepimpled creature who doted on dolly who bullied her. with linda hall the school tennis champion, dolly played singles at least twice a week i suspect linda was a true nymphet, but for some unknown reason she did not comewas perhaps not allowed to cometo our house so i recall her only as a flash of natural sunshine on an indoor court. of the rest, none had any claims to nymphetry except eva rosen. avis ws a plump lateral child with hairy legs, while mona, though handsome in a coarse sensual way and only a year older than my aging mistress, had obviously long ceased to be a nymphet, if she ever had been one. eva rosen, a displaced little person from france, was on the other hand a good example of a not strikingly beautiful child revealing to the perspicacious amateur some of the basic elements of nymphet charm, such as a perfect pubescent figure and lingering eyes and high cheekbones. her glossy copper hair had lolitas silkiness, and the features of her delicate milkywhite face with pink lips and silverfish eyelashes were less foxy than those of her likesthe great clan of intraracial redheads nor did she sport their green uniform but wore, as i remember her, a lot of black or cherry darka very smart black pullover, for instance, and highheeled black shoes, and garnetred fingernail polish. i spoke french to her much to los disgust. the childs tonalities were still admirably pure, but for school words and play words she resorted to current american and then a slight brooklyn accent would crop up in her speech, which was amusing in a little parisian who went to a select new england school with phoney british aspirations. unfortunately, despite that french kids uncle being a millionaire, lo dropped eva for some reason before i had had time to enjoy in my modest way her fragrant presence in the humbert open house. the reader knows what importance i attached to having a bevy of page girls, consolation prize nymphets, around my lolita. for a while, i endeavored to interest my senses in mona dahl who was a good deal around, especially during the spring term when lo and she got so enthusiastic about dramatics. i have often wondered what secrets outrageously treacherous dolores haze had imparted to mona while blurting out to me by urgent and wellpaid request various really incredible details concerning an affair that mona had had with a marine at the seaside. it was characteristic of lo that she chose for her closest chum that elegant, cold, lascivious, experienced young female whom i once heard misheard, lo swore cheerfully say in the hallway to lowho had remarked that her los sweater was of virgin wool the only thing about you that is, kiddo she had a curiously husky voice, artificially waved dull dark hair, earrings, amberbrown prominent eyes and luscious lips. lo said teachers had remonstrated with her on her loading herself with so much costume jewelry. her hands trembled. she was burdened with a  i.q. and i also knew she had a tremendous chocolatebrown mole on he womanish back which i inspected the night lo and she had worn lowcut pastelcolored, vaporous dresses for a dance at the butler academy.         i am anticipating a little, but i cannot help running my memory all over the keyboard of that shcool year. in the meeting my attempts to find out what kind of boys lo knew, miss dahl was elegantly evasive. lo who had gone to play tennis at lindas country club had telephoned she might be a full half hour late, and so, would i enteretain mona who was coming to practice with her a scene from          the taming of the shrew.using all the modulations, all the allure of manner and voice she was capable of and staring at me with perhapscould i be mistakena faint gleam of crystalline irony, beautiful mona replied well, sir, the fact is dolly is not much concerned with mere boys. fact is, we are rivals. she and i have a crush on the reverend rigger. this was a jokei have already mentioned that gloomy giant of a man, with the jaw of a horse he was to bore me to near murder with his impressions of switzerland at a tea party for parents that i am unable to place correctly in terms of time.         how had the ball been oh, it had been a riot. a what a panic. terrific, in a word. had lo danced a lot oh, not a frightful lot, just as much as she could stand. what did she, languorous mona, think of lo sir did she think lo was doing well at school gosh, she certainly was quite a kid. but her general behavior was oh, she was a swell kid. but still oh, shes a doll, concluded mona, and sighed abruptly, and picked up a book that happened to lie at hand, and with a change of expression, falsely furrowing her brow, inquired do tell me about ball zack, sir. is he really that good she moved up so close to my chair that i made out through lotions and creams her uninteresting skin scent. a sudden odd thought stabbed me was my lo playing the pimp if so, she had found the wrong substitute. avoiding mona cool gaze, i talked literature for a minute. then dolly arrivedand slit her pale eyes at us. i left the two friends to their own devices. one of the latticed squares in a small cobwebby casement window at the turn of the staircase was glazed with ruby, and that raw wound among the unstained rectangles and its asymmetrical positiona nights move from the topalways strangely disturbed me.                                             sometimes come on, how often exactly, bert can you recall four, five, more such occasions or would no human heart have survived two or three sometimes i have nothing to say in reply to your question, while lolita would be haphazardly preparing her homework, sucking a pencil, lolling sideways in an easy chair with both legs over its arm, i would shed all my pedagogic restraint, dismiss all our quarrels, forget all my masculine prideand literally crawl on my knees to your chair, my lolita you would give me one looka gray furry question mark of a look oh no, not again incredulity, exasperation for you never deigned to believe that i could, without any specific designs, ever crave to bury my face in your plaid skirt, my darling the fragility of those bare arms of yourshow i longed to enfold them, all your four limpid lovely limbs, a folded colt, and take your head between my unworthy hands, and pull the templeskin back on both sides, and kiss your chinesed eyes, andpulease, leave me alone, will you, you would say, for christs sake leave me alone. and i would get up from the floor while you looked on, your face deliberately twitching in imitation of my          tic nerveux. but never mind, never mind, i am only a brute, never mind, let us go on with my miserable story.                                             one monday forenoon, in december i think, pratt asked me to come over for a talk. dollys last report had been poor, i knew. but instead of contenting myself with some such plausible explaination of this summons, i imagined all sort of horrors, and had to fortify myself with a pint of my pin before i could face the interview. slowly, all adams apple and heart, i went up the steps of the scaffold.         a huge women, grayhaired, frowsy, with a broad flat nose and small eyes behind blackrimmed glassessit down, she said, pointing to an informal and humiliating hassock, while she perched with ponderous spryness on the arm of an oak chair. for a moment or two, she peered at me with smiling curiosity.she had done it at our first meeting, i recalled, but i could afford then to scowl back. her eye left me. she lapsed into thoughtprobably assumed. making up her mind she rubbed, fold on fold, her dark gray flannel skirt at the knee, dispelling a trace of chalk or something. then she said, still rubbing, not looking up         let me ask a blunt question, mr. haze. you are an oldfashioned continental father, arent you         why, no, i said, conservative, perhaps, but not what you would call oldfashioned.         she sighed, frowned, then clapped her big plump hands together in a letsgetdowntobusiness manner, and again fixed her beady eyes upon me.         dolly haze, she said, is a lovely child, but the onset of sexual maturing seems to give her trouble.         i bowed slightly. what else could i do         she is still shuttling, said miss pratt, showing how with her liverspotted hands, between the anal and genital zones of development. basically she is a lovely         i beg your pardon, i said, what zones         thats the oldfashioned european in you cried pratt delivering a slight tap on my wrist watch and suddenly disclosing her dentures. all i mean is that biologic drivesdo you smokeare not fused in dolly, do not fall so to speak into ainto a rounded pattern. her hands held for a moment an invisible melon.         she is attractive, birght though careless breathing heavily, without leaving her perch, the woman took time out to look at the lovely childs report sheet on the desk at her right. her marks are getting worse and worse. now i wonder, mr. haze again the false meditation.         well, she went on with zest, as for me, i do smoke, and, as dear dr. pierce used to say im not proud of it but i jeest love it. she lit up and the smoke she exhaled from her nostrils was like a pair of tusks.         let me give you a few details, it wont take a moment. now here let me see rummaging among her papers. she is defiant toward miss redcock and impossibly rude to miss cormorant. now here is one of our special research reports enjoys singing with group in class though mind seems to wander. crosses her knees and wags left leg to rhythm. type of bywords a twohundredfortytwo word area of the commonest pubescent slang fenced in by a number of obviously european polysyllabics. sighs a good deal in class. let me see. yes. now comes the last week in november. sighs a good deal in class. chews gum vehemently. does not bite her nails though if she did, this would conform better to her general patternscientifically speaking, of course. menstruation, according to the subject, well established. belongs at present to no church organization. by the way, mr. haze, her mother was oh, i see. and you are nobodys business is, i suppose, gods business. something else we wanted to know. she was no regular home duties, i understand. making a princess of your dolly, mr. haze, he well, what else have we got here handles books gracefully. voice pleasant. giggles rather often. a little dreamy. has private jokes of her own, transposing for instance the first letters of some of her teachers names. hair light and dark brown, lustrouswell laughing you are aware of          that, i suppose. nose unobstructed, feet higharched, eyeslet me see, i had here somewhere a still more recent report. aha, here we are. miss gold says dollys tennis form is excellent to superb, even better than linda halls, but concentration and pointaccumulation are just poor to fair. miss cormorant cannot decide whether dolly has exceptional emotional control or none at all. miss horn reports shei mean, dollycannot verbalize her emotions, while according to miss cole dollys metabolic efficiency is superfine. miss molar thinks dolly is myopic and should see a good ophthalmologist, but miss redcock insists that the girl simulates eyestrain to get away with scholastic incompetence. and to conclude, mr. haze, our researchers are wondering about something really crucial. now i want to ask you something. i want to know if your poor wife, or yourself, or anyone else in the familyi understand she has several aunts and a maternal grandfather in californiaoh,          hadim sorrywell, we all wonder if anybody in the family has instructed dolly in the process of mammalian reproduction. the general impression is that fifteenyearold dolly remains morbidly uninterested in sexual matters, or to be exact, represses her curiosity in order to save her ignorance and selfdignity. all rightfourteen. you see, mr. haze, beardsley school does not believe in bees and blossoms, and storks and love birds, but it does believe very strongly in preparing its students for mutually satisfactory mating and successful child rearing. we feel dolly could make excellent progress if only she would put her mind to her work. miss cormorants report is significant in that respect. dolly is inclined to be, mildly speaking impudent. but all feel that          primo, you should have your family doctor tell her the facts of life and          , secudno, that you allow her to enjoy the company of her schoolmates brothers at the junior club or in dr. riggers organization, or in the lovely homes of our parents.         she may meet boys at her own lovely home, i said.         i hope she will, said pratt buoyantly. when we questioned her about her troubles, dolly refused to discuss the home situation, but we have spoken to some of her friends and reallywell, for example, we insist you unveto her nonparticiaption in the dramatic group. you just must allow her to tak part in          the hunted enchanters. she was such a perfect little nymph in the tryout, and sometime in spring the author will stay for a few days at beardsley college and may attend a rehearsal or two in our new auditorium. i mean it is all part of the fun of being young and alive and beautiful. you must understand         i always thought of myself, i said, as a very understanding father.         oh, no doubt, no doubt, but miss cormorant thinks, and i am inclined to agree with her, that dolly is obsessed by sexual thoughts for which she finds no outlet, and will tease and martyrize other girls, or even our younger instructors because          theydo have innocent dates with boys.         shrugged my shoulders. a shabby          migr.         let us put our two heads together, mr. haze. what on earth is wrong with that child         she seems quite normal and happy to me, i said disaster coming at last was i found out had they got some hypnotist.         what worries me, said miss pratt looking at her watch and starting to go over the whole subject again, is that both teachers and schoolmates find dolly antagonistic, dissatisfied, cageyand everybody wonders why you are so firly opposed to all the natural recreations of a normal child.         do you mean sex play i asked jauntily, in despair, a cornered old rat.         well, i certainly welcome this civilized terminology, said pratt with a grin. but this is not quite the point. under the auspices of beardsley school, dramatics, dances and other natural activities are not technically sex play, though girls do meet boys, if that is what you object to.         all right, i said, my hassock exhaling a weary sign. you win. she can take part in that play. provided male parts are taken by female parts.         i am always fascinated, said pratt, by the admirable way foreignersor at least naturalized americansuse our rich language. im sure miss gold, who conducts the play group, will be overjoyed. i notice she is one of the few teachers that seem to likei mean who seem to find dolly manageable. this takes care of general topics, i guess now comes a special matter. we are in trouble again.         pratt paused truculently, then rubbed her index finger under her nostrils with such vigor that her nose performed a kind of war dance.         im a frank person, she said, but conventions are conventions, and i find it difficult let me put it this way the walkers, who live in what we call around here the dukes manor, you know the great gray house on the hillthey send their two girls to our school, and we have the niece of president moore with us, a really gracious child, not to speak of a number of other prominent children. well, under the circumstances, it is rather a jolt when dolly, who looks like a little lady, uses words which you as a foreigner probably simply do not know or do not understand. perhaps it might be betterwould you like me to have dolly come up here right away to discuss things no you seeoh well, lets have it out. dolly has written a most obscene fourletter word which our dr. cutler tells me is lowmexican for urinal with her lipstick on some health pamphlets which miss redcock, who is getting married in june, distributed among the girls, and we thought she should stay after hoursanother half hour at least. but if you like         no, i said, i dont want to interfere with rules. i shall talk to her later. i shall thrash it out.         do, said the woman rising from her chair arm. and perhaps we can get together again soon, and if things do not improve we might have dr. cutler analyze her.         should i marry pratt and strangle her         and perhaps your family doctor might like to examine her physicallyjust a routine checkup. she is in mushroomthe last classroom along that passage.         beardsley school, it may be explained, copied a famous girls school in england by having traditional nicknames for its various classrooms mushroom, roomin , broom, roomba and so on. mushroom was smelly, with a sepia print of reynolds age of innocence above the chalkboard, and several rows of clumsylooking pupil desks. at one of these, my lolita was reading the chapter on dialogue in bakers          dramatic technique, and all was very quiet, and there was another girl with a very naked, porcelainwhite neck and wonderful platinum hair, who sat in front reading too, absolutely lost to the world and interminably winding a soft curl around one finger, and i sat beside dolly just behind that neck and that hair, and unbuttoned my overcoat and for sixtyfive cents plus the permission to participate in the school play, had dolly put her inky, chalky, redknuckled hand under the desk. oh, stupid and reckless of me, no doubt, but after the torture i had been subjected to, i simply had to take advantage of a combination that i knew would never occur again.                                             around christmas she caught a bad chill and was examined by a friend of miss lester, a dr. ilse tristramson hi, ilse, you were a dear, uninquisitive soul, and you touched my dove very gently. she diagnosed bronchitis, patted lo on the back all its bloom erect because of the fever and put her to bed for a week or longer. at first she ran a temperature in american parlance, and i could not resist the exquisite caloricity of unexpected delightsvenus febriculosathough it was a very languid lolita that moaned and coughed and shivered in my embrace. and as soon as she was well again, i threw a party with boys.         perhaps i had drunk a little too much in preparation for the ordeal. perhaps i made a fool of myself. the girls had decorated and plugged in a small fir treegerman custom, except that colored bulbs had superseded wax candles. records were chosen and fed into my landlords phonograph. chic dolly wore a nice gray dress with fitted bodice and flared skirt. humming, i retired to my study upstairsand then every ten or twenty minutes i would come down like an idiot just for a few seconds to pick up ostensibly my pipe from the mantelpiece or hunt for the newspaper and with every new visit these simple actions became harder to perform, and i was reminded of the dreadfully distant days when i used to brace myself to casually enter a room in the ramsdale house where little carmen was on.         the party was not a success. of the three girls invited, one did not come at all, and one of the boys brought his cousin roy, so there was a superfluity of two boys, and the cousins knew all the steps, and the other fellows could hardly dance at all, and most of the evening was spent in messing up the kitchen, and then endlessly jabbering about what card game to play, and sometime later, two girls and four boys sat on the floor of the living room, with all windows open, and played a word game which opal could not be made to understand, while mona and roy, a lean handsome lad, drank ginger ale in the kitchen, sitting on the table and dangling their legs, and hotly discussing predestination and the law of averages. after they had all gone my lo said ugh, closed her eyes, and dropped into a chair with all four limbs starfished to express the utmost disgust and exhaustion and swore it was the most revolting bunch of boys she had ever seen. i bought her a new tennis racket for that remark.         january was humid and warm, and february fooled the forsythia none of the townspeople had ever          seensuch weather. other presents came tumbling in. for her birthday i bought her a bicycle, the doelike and altogether charming machine already mentionedand added to this a          history of modern american painting her bicycle manner, i mean her approach to it, the hip movement in mounting, the grace and so on, afforded me supreme pleasure but my attempt to refine her pictorial taste was a failure she wanted to know if the guy noonnapping on doris lees hay was the father of the pseudovoluptuous hoyden in the foreground, and could not understand why i said grant wood or peter hurd was good, and reginald marsh or frederick waugh awful.                                             by the time spring had touched up thayer street with yellow and green and pink, lolita was irrevocably stagestruck. pratt, whom i chanced to notice one sunday lunching with some people at walton inn, caught my eye from afar and went through the motion of sympathetically and discreetly clapping her hands while lo was not looking. i detest the theatre as being a primitive and putrid form, historically speaking a form that smacks of stoneage rites and communal nonsense despite those individual injections of genius, such as, say, elizabethan poetry which a closeted reader automatically pumps out of the stuff. being much occupied at the time with my own literary labors, i did not bother to read the complete text of          the enchanted hunters, the playlet in which dolores haze was assigned the part of a farmers daughter who imagines herself to be a woodland witch, or diana, or something, and who, having got hold of a book on hypnotism, plunges a number of lost hunters into various entertaining trances before falling in her turn under the spell of a vagabond poet mona dahl. that much i gleaned from bits of crumpled and poorly typed script that lo sowed all over the house. the coincidence of the title with the name of an unforgettable inn was pleasant in a sad little way i wearily thought i had better not bring it to my own enchantresss notice, lest a brazen accusation of mawkishness hurt me even more than her failure to notice it for herself had done. i assumed the playlet was just another, practically anonymous, version of some banal legend. nothing prevented one, of course, from supposing that in quest of an attractive name the founder of the hotel had been immediately and solely influenced by the chance fantasy of the secondrate muralist he had hired, and that subsequently the hotels name had suggested the plays title. but in my credulous, simple, benevolent mind i happened to twist it the other way round, and without giving the whole matter much though really, supposed that mural, name and title had all been derived from a common source, from some local tradition, which i, an alien unversed in new england lore, would not be supposed to know. in consequence i was under the impression all this quite casually, you understand, quite outside my orbit of importance that the accursed playlet belonged to the type of whimsy for juvenile consumption, arranged and rearranged many times, such as          hansel and gretelby richard roe, or          the sleeping beautyby dorothy doe, or          the emperors new clothesby maurice vermont and marion rumpelmeyerall this to be found in any          plays for school actorsor          lets have a playin other words, i did not knowand would not have cared, if i did that actually          the enchanted hunterswas a quite recent and technically original composition which had been produced for the first time only three or four months ago by a highbrow group in new york. to meinasmuch as i could judge from my charmers partit seemed to be a pretty dismal kind of fancy work, with echoes from lenormand and maeterlinck and various quiet british dreamers. the redcapped, uniformly attired hunters, of which one was a banker, another a plumber, a third a policeman, a fourth an undertaker, a fifth an underwriter, a sixth an escaped convict you see the possibilities, went through a complete change of mind in dollys dell, and remembered their real lives only as dreams or nightmares from which little diana had aroused them but a seventh hunter in a          greencap, the fool was a young poet, and he insisted, much to dianas annoyance, that she and the entertainment provided dancing nymphs, and elves, and monsters were his, the poets, invention. i understand that finally, in utter disgust at his cocksureness, barefooted dolores was to lead checktrousered mona to the paternal farm behind the perilous forest to prove to the braggart she was not a poets fancy, but a rustic, downtobrownearth lassand a lastminute kiss was to enforce the plays profound message, namely, that mirage and reality merge in love. i considered it wiser not to criticize the thing in front of lo she was so healthily engrossed in problems of expression, and so charmingly did she put her narrow florentine hands together, batting her eyelashes and pleading with me not to come to rehearsals as some ridiculous parents did because she wanted to dazzle me with a perfect first nightand because i was, anyway, always butting in and saying the wrong thing, and cramping her style in the presence of other people.         there was one very special rehearsal my heart, my heart there was one day in may marked by a lot of gay flurryit all rolled past, beyond my ken, immune to my memory, and when i saw lo next, in the late afternoon, balancing on her bike, pressing the palm of her hand to the damp bark of a young birch tree on the edge of our lawn, i was so struck by the radiant tenderness of her smile that for an instant i believed all our troubles gone. can you remember, she said, what was the name of that hotel,          youknow nose pucketed, come on, you knowwith those white columns and the marble swan in the lobby oh, you know noisy exhalation of breaththe hotel where you raped me. okay, skip it. i mean, was it almost in a whisper the enchanted hunters oh, it was musingly was itand with a yelp of amorous vernal laughter she slapped the glossy bole and tore uphill, to the end of the street, and then rode back, feet at rest on stopped pedals, posture relaxed, one hand dreaming in her printflowered lap.                                             because it supposedly tied up with her interest in dance and dramatics, i had permitted lo to take piano lessons with a miss emperor as we french scholars may conveniently call her to whose blueshuttered little white house a mile or so beyond beardsley lo would spin off twice a week. one friday night toward the end of may and a week or so after the very special rehearsal lo had not had me attend the telephone in my study, where i was in the act of mopping up gustavesi mean gastonskings side, rang and miss emperor asked if lo was coming next tuesday because she had missed last tuesdays and todays lessons. i said she would by all meansand went on with the game. as the reader may well imagine, my faculties were now impaired, and a move or two later, with gaston to play, i noticed through the film of my general distress that he could collect my queen he noticed it too, but thinking it might be a trap on the part of his tricky opponent, he demurred for quite a minute, and puffed and wheezed, and shook his jowls, and even shot furtive glances at me, and made hesitating halfthrusts with his pudgily bunched fingersdying to take that juicy queen and not daringand all of a sudden he swooped down upon it who knows if it did not teach him certain later audacities, and i spent a dreary hour in achieving a draw. he finished his brandy and presently lumbered away, quite satisfied with this result           mon         pauvre ami, je ne vous ai jamais revu et quoiquil y ait bien peu de chance que vous voyiez mon livre, permiettezmoi de vous dire que je vous serre la main bien cordialement, et que toutes mes fillettes vous saluent. i found dolores haze at the kitchen table, consuming a wedge of pie, with her eyes fixed on her script. they rose to meet mine with a kind of celestial vapidity. she remained singularly unruffled when confronted with my discovery, and said          dun petit air faussement contritthat she knew she was a very wicked kid, but simply had not been able to resist the enchantment, and had used up those music hourso reader, my readerin a nearby public park rehearsing the magic forest scene with mona. i said fineand stalked to the telephone. monas mother answered oh yes, shes in and retreated with a mothers neutral laugh of polite pleasure to shout off stage roy calling and the very next moment mona rustled up, and forthwith, in a low monotonous not untender voice started berating roy for something he had said or done and i interrupted her, and presently mona was saying in her humbles, sexiest contralto, yes, sir, surely, sir i am alone to blame, sir, in this unfortunate business, what elocution what poise honest, i feel very bad about itand so on and so forth as those little harlots say.         so downstairs i went clearing my throat and holding my heart. lo was now in the living room, in her favorite overstuffed chair. as she sprawled there, biting at a hangnail an mocking me with her heartless vaporous eyes, and all the time rocking a stool upon which she had placed the heel of an outstretched shoeless foot, i perceived all at once with a sickening qualm how much she had changed since i first met her two years ago. or had this happened during those last two weeks          tendressesurely that was an exploded myth. she sat right in the focus of my incandescent anger. the fog of all lust had been swept away leaving nothing but this dreadful lucidity. oh, she had changed her complexion was now that of any vulgar untidy highschool girl who applies shared cosmetics with grubby fingers to an unwashed face and does not mind what soiled texture, what pustulate epidermis comes in contact with her skin. its smooth tender bloom had been so lovely in former days, so bright with tears, when i used to roll, in play, her tousled head on my knee. a coarse flush had now replaced that innocent fluorescence. what was locally known as a rabbit cold had painted with flaming pink the edges of her contemptuous nostrils. as in terror i lowered my gaze, it mechanically slid along the underside of her tensely stretched bare thighhow polished and muscular her legs had grown she kept her wideset eyes, cloudedglass gray and slightly bloodshot, fixed upon me, and i saw the stealthy thought showing through them that perhaps after all mona was right, and she, orphan lo, could expose me without getting penalized herself. how wrong i was. how mad i was everything about her was of the same exasperating impenetrable orderthe strength of her shapely legs, the dirty sole of her white sock, the thick sweater she wore despite the closeness of the room, her wenchy smell, and especially the dead end of her face with its strange flush and freshly madeup lips. some of the red had left stains on her front teeth, and i was struck by a ghastly recollectionthe evoked image not of monique, but of another young prostitute in a bellhouse, ages ago, who had been snapped up by somebody else before i had time to decide whether her mere youth warranted my risking some appalling disease, and who had just such flushed prominent          pommettesand a dead          maman, and big front teeth, and a bit of dingy red ribbon in her countrybrown hair.         well, speak, said lo. was the corroboration satisfactory         oh, yes, i said. perfect. yes. and i do not doubt you two made it up. as a matter of fact, i do not doubt you have told her everything about us.         oh, yah         i controlled my breath and said dolores, this must stop right away. i am ready to yank you out of beardsley and lock you up you know where, but this must stop. i am ready to take you away the time it takes to pack a suitcase. this must stop or else anything may happen.         anything may happen, huh         i snatched away the stool she was rocking with her heel and her foot fell with a thud on the floor.         hey, she cried, take it easy.         first of all you go upstairs, i cried in my turn,and simultaneously grabbed at her and pulled her up. from that moment, i stopped restraining my voice, and we continued yelling at each other, and she said, unprintable things. she said she loathed me. she made monstrous faces at me, inflating her cheeks and producing a diabolical plopping sound. she said i had attempted to violate her several times when i was her mothers roomer. she said she was sure i had murdered her mother. she said she would sleep with the very first fellow who asked her and i could do nothing about it. i said she was to go upstairs and show me all her hiding places. it was a strident and hateful scene. i held her by her knobby wrist and she kept turning and twisting it this way and that, surreptitiously trying to find a weak point so as to wrench herself free at a favorable moment, but i held her quite hard and in fact hurt her rather badly for which i hope my heart may rot, and once or twice she jerked her arm so violently that i feared her wrist might snap, and all the while she stared at me with those unforgettable eyes where could anger and hot tears struggled, and our voices were drowning the telephone, and when i grew aware of its ringing she instantly escaped.         with people in movies i seem to share the services of the machina telephonica and its sudden god. this time it was an irate neighbor. the east window happened to be agape in the living room, with the blind mercifully down, however and behind it the damp black night of a sour new england spring had been breathlessly listening to us. i had always thought that type of haddocky spinster with the obscene mind was the result of considerable literary inbreeding in modern fiction but now i am convinced that prude and prurient miss eastor to explode her incognito, miss fenton lebonehad been probably protruding threequarterway from her bedroom window as she strove to catch the gist of our quarrel.         this racket lacks all sense of quacked the receiver, we do not live in a tenement here. i must emphatically         i apologized for my daughters friends being so loud. young people, you knowand cradled the next quack and a half.         downstairs the screen door banged. lo escaped         through the casement on the stairs i saw a small impetuous ghost slip through the shrubs a silvery dot in the darkhub of the bicycle wheelmoved, shivered, and she was gone.         it so happened that the car was spending the night in a repair shop downtown. i had no other alternative than to pursue on foot the winged fugitive. even now, after more than three years have heaved and elapsed, i cannot visualize that springnight street, that already so leafy street, without a gasp of panic. before their lighted porch miss lester was promenading miss favians dropsical dackel. mr. hyde almost knocked it over. walk three steps and runt three. a tepid rain started to drum on the chestnut leaves. at the next corner, pressing lolita against an iron railing, a blurred youth held and kissedno, not her, mistake. my talons still tingling, i flew on.         half a mile or so east of number fourteen, thayer street tangles with a private lane and a cross street the latter leads to the town proper in front of the first drugstore, i sawwith what melody of relieflolitas fair bicycle waiting for her. i pushed instead of pulling, pulled, pushed, pulled, and entered. look out some ten paces away lolita, though the glass of a telephone booth membranous god still with us, cupping the tube, confidentially hunched over it, slit her eyes at me, turned away with her treasure, hurriedly hung up, and walked out with a flourish.         tried to reach you at home, she said brightly. a great decision has been made. but first buy me a drink, dad.         she watched the listless pale fountain girl put in the ice, pour in the coke, add the cherry syrupand my heart was bursting with loveache. that childish wrist. my lovely child. you have a lovely child, mr. humbert. we always admire her as she passes by. mr. pim watched pippa suck in the concoction.                  jai toujours admir laeuvre du sublime dublinois. and in the meantime the rain had become a voluptuous shower.         look, she said as she rode the bike beside me, one foot scraping the darkly glistening sidewalk, look, ive decided something. i want to leave school i hate that school i hate the play, i really do never go back. find another. leave at once. go for a long trip again. but          thistime well go wherever          iwant, wont we         i nodded. my lolita.         i choose          cest entendu she asked wobbling a little beside me. used french only when she was a very good little girl.         okay.          entendu. now hophophop, lenore, or youll get soaked. a storm of sobs was filling my chest.         she bared her teeth and after her adorable schoolgirl fashioned, leaned forward, and away she sped, my bird.         miss lesters finely groomed hand held a porchdoor open for a waddling old dog          qui prenait son temps.         lo was waiting for me near the ghostly birch tree.         i am drenched, she declared at the top of her voice. are you glad to hell with the play see what i mean         an invisible hags claw slammed down an upperfloor window.         in our hallway, ablaze with welcoming lights, my lolita peeled off her sweater, shook her gemmed hair, stretched towards me two bare arms, raised one knee         carry me upstairs, please. i feel sort of romantic tonight.         it may interest physiologists to learn, at this point, that i have the abilitya most singular case, i presumeof shedding torrents of tears throughout the other tempest.                                             the brakes were relined, the waterpipes unclogged, the valves ground, and a number of other repairs and improvements were paid for by not very mechanicallyminded but prudent papa humbert, so that the late mrs. humberts car was in respectable shape when ready to undertake a new journey.         we had promised beardsley school, good old beardsley school, that we would be back as soon as my hollywood engagement came to an end inventive humbert was to be, i hinted, chief consultant in the production of a film dealing with existentialism, still a hot thing at the time. actually i was toying with the idea of gently trickling across the mexican borderi was braver now than last yearand there deciding what to do with my little concubine who was now sixty inches tall and weighed ninety pounds. we had dug out our tour books and maps. she had traced our route with immense zest. was it thanks to those theatricals that she had now outgrown her juvenile jaded airs and was so adorably keen to explore rich reality i experienced the queer lightness of dreams that pale but warm sunday morning when we abandoned professor chems puzzled house and sped along main street toward the fourlane highway. my loves striped, blackandwhite cotton frock, jauntry blue with the large beautifully cut aquamarine on a silver chainlet, which gemmed her throat a spring rain gift from me. we passed the new hotel, and she laughed. a penny for your thoughts, i said and she stretched out her palm at once, but at that moment i had to apply the breaks rather abruptly at a red light. as we pulled up, another car came to a gliding stop alongside, and a very striking looking, athletically lean young woman where had i seen her with a high complexion and shoulderlength brilliant bronze hair, greeted lo with a ringing hiand then, addressing me, effusively, edusively placed, stressing certain words, said what a          shameto was to          teardolly away from the playyou should have          heardthe author          ravingabout her after that rehearsal green light, you dope, said lo under her breath, and simultaneously, waving in bright adieu a bangled arm, joan of arc in a performance we saw at the local theatre violently outdistanced us to swerve into campus avenue.         who was it exactly vermont or rumpelmeyer         noedusa goldthe gal who coaches us.         i was not referring to her. who exactly concocted that play         oh yes, of course. some old woman, clare something, i guess. there was quite a crowd of them there.         so she complimented you         complimented my eyeshe kissed me on my pure browand my darling emitted that new yelp of merriment whichperhaps in connection with her theatrical mannerismsshe had lately begun to affect.         you are a funny creature, lolita, i saidor some such words. naturally, i am overjoyed you gave up that absurd stage business. but what is curious is that you dropped the whole thing only a week before its natural climax. oh, lolita, you should be careful of those surrenders of yours. i remember you gave up ramsdale for camp, and camp for a joyride, and i could list other abrupt changes in your disposition. you must be careful. there are things that should never be given up. you must persevere. you should try to be a little nicer to me, lolita. you should also watch your diet. the tour of your thigh, you know, should not exceed seventeen and a half inches. more might be fatal i was kidding, of course. we are now setting out on a long happy journey. i remember                                             i remember as a child in europe gloating over a map of north america that had appalachian mountains boldly running from alabama up to new brunswick, so that the whole region they spannedtennessee, the virginias, pennsylvania, new york, vermont, new hampshire and maine, appeared to my imagination as a gigantic switzerland or even tibet, all mountain, glorious diamond peak upon peak, giant conifers,          le montagnard migrin his bear skin glory, and          felis tigris goldsmithi, and red indians under the catalpas. that it all boiled down to a measly suburban lawn and a smoking garbage incinerator, was appalling. farewell, appalachia leaving it, we crossed ohio, the three states beginning with i, and nebraskaah, that first whiff of the west we traveled very leisurely, having more than a week to reach wace, continental divide, where she passionately desired to see he ceremonial dances marking the seasonal opening of magic cave, and at least three weeks to reach elphinstone, gem of a western state where she yearned to climb red rock from which a mature screen star had recently jumped to her death after a drunken row with her gigolo.         again we were welcomed to wary motels by means of inscriptions that read         we wish you feel at home while here.          allequipment was carefully checked upon your arrival. your license number is on record here. use hot water sparingly. we reserve the right to eject without notice any objectionable person. do not throw waste material of          anykind in the toilet bowl. thank you. call again. the management. p.s. we consider our guests the finest people of the world.         in these frightening places we paid ten for twins, flies queued outside at the screenless door and successfully scrambled in, the ashes of our predecessors still lingered in the ashtrays, a womans hair lay on the pillow, one heard ones neighbor hanging his coat in his closet, the hangers were ingeniously fixed to their bars by coils of wire so as to thwart theft, and, in crowning insult, the pictures above the twin beds were identical twins. i also noticed that commercial fashion was changing. there was a tendency for cabins to fuse and gradually form the caravansary, and, lo she was not interested but the reader may be, a second story was added, and a lobby grew in, and cars were removed to a communal garage, and the motel reverted to the good old hotel.         i now warn the reader not to mock me and my mental daze. it is easy for him and me to decipher          nowa past destiny but a destiny in the making is, believe me, not one of those honest mystery stories where all you have to do is keep an eye on the clues. in my youth i once read a french detective tale where the clues were actually in italics but that is not mcfates wayeven if one does learn to recognize certain obscure indications.         for instance i would not swear that there was not at least one occasion, prior to, or at the very beginning of, the midwest lap of our journey, when she managed to convey some information to, or otherwise get into contact with, a person or persons unknown. we had stopped at a gas station, under the sign of pegasus, and she had slipped out of her seat and escaped to the rear of the premises while the raised hood, under which i had bent to watch the mechanics manipulations, hid her for a moment from my sight. being inclined to be lenient, i only shook my benign head though strictly speaking such visits were taboo, since i felt instinctively that toiletsas also telephoneshappened to be, for reasons unfathomable, the points where my destiny was liable to catch. we all have such fateful objectsit may be a recurrent landscape in one case, a number in anothercarefully chosen by the gods to attract events of special significance for us here shall john always stumble there shall janes heart always break.         wellmy car had been attended to, and i had moved it away from the pumps to let a pickup truck be servicedwhen the growing volume of her absence began to weigh upon me in the windy grayness. not for the first time, and not for the last, had i stared in such dull discomfort of mind at those stationary trivialities that look almost surprised, like staring rustics, to find themselves in the stranded travelers field of vision that green garbage can, those very black, very whitewalled tires for sale, those bright cans of motor oil, that red icebox with assorted drinks, the four, five, seven discarded bottles within the incompleted crossword puzzle of their wooden cells, that bug patiently walking up the inside of the window of the office. radio music was coming from its open door, and because the rhythm was not synchronized with the heave and flutter and other gestures of windanimated vegetation, one had the impression of an old scenic film living its own life while piano or fiddle followed a line of music quite outside the shivering flower, the swaying branch. the sound of charlottes last sob incongruously vibrated through me as, with her dress fluttering athwart the rhythm, lolita veered from a totally unexpected direction. she had found the toilet occupied and had crossed over to the sign of the conche in the next block. they said there they were proud of their homeclean restrooms. these prepaid postcards, they said, had been provided for your comments. no postcards. no soap. nothing. no comments.         that day or the next, after a tedious drive through a land of food crops, we reached a pleasant little burg and put up at chestnut courtnice cabins, damp green grounds, apple trees, an old swingand a tremendous sunset which the tried child ignored. she had wanted to go through kasbeam because it was only thirty miles north from her home town but on the following morning i found her quite listless, with no desire to see again the sidewalk where she had played hopscotch some five years before. for obvious reasons i had rather dreaded that side trip, even though we had agreed not to make ourselves conspicuous in any wayto remain in the car and not look up old friends. my relief at her abandoning the project was spoiled by the thought that had she felt i were totally against the nostalgic possibilities of pisky, as i had been last year, she would not have given up so easily. on my mentioning this with a sigh, she sighed too and complained of being out of sorts. she wanted to remain in bed till teatime at least, with lots of magazines, and then if she felt better she suggested we just continue westward. i must say she was very sweet and languid, and craved for fresh fruits, and i decided to go and fetch her a toothsome picnic lunch in kasbeam. our cabin stood on the timbered crest of a hill, and from our window you could see the road winding down, and then running as straight as a hair parting between two rows of chestnut trees, towards the pretty town, which looked singularly distinct and toylike in the pure morning distance. one could make out an elflike girl on an insectlike bicycle, and a dog, a bit too large proportionately, all as clear as those pilgrims and mules winding up waxpale roads in old paintings with blue hills and red little people. i have the european urge to use my feet when a drive can be dispensed with, so i leisurely walked down, eventually meeting the cyclista plain plump girl with pigtails, followed by a huge st. bernard dog with orbits like pansies. in kasbeam a very old barber gave me a very mediocre haircut he babbled of a baseballplaying son of his, and, at every explodent, spat into my neck, and every now and then wiped his glasses on my sheetwrap, or interrupted his tremulous scissor work to produce faded newspaper clippings, and so inattentive was i that it came as a shock to realize as he pointed to an easeled photograph among the ancient gray lotions, that the mustached young ball player had been dead for the last thirty years.         i had a cup of hot flavorless coffee, bought a bunch of bananas for my monkey, and spent another ten minutes or so in a delicatessen store. at least an hour and a half must have elapsed when this homewardbound little pilgrim appeared on the winding road leading to chestnut castle.         the girl i had seen on my way to town was now loaded with linen and engaged in helping a misshapen man whose big head and coarse features reminded me of the bertoldo character in low italian comedy. they were cleaning the cabins of which there was a dozen or so on chestnut crest, all pleasantly spaced amid the copious verdure. it was noon, and most of them, with a final bang of their screen doors, had already got rid of their occupants. a very elderly, almost mummylike couple in a very new model were in the act of creeping out of one of the contiguous garages from another a red hood protruded in somewhat codpiece fashion and nearer to our cabin, a strong and handsome young man with a shock of black hair and blue eyes was putting a portable refrigerator into a station wagon. for some reason he gave me a sheepish grin as i passed. on the grass expanse opposite, in the manylimbed hsade of luxuriant trees, the familiar st. bernard dog was guarding his mistress bicycle, and nearby a young woman, far gone in the family way, had seated a rapt baby on a swing and was rocking it gently, while a jealous boy of two or three was making a nuisance of himself by trying to push or pull the swing board he finally succeeded in getting himself knocked down by it, and bawled loudly as he lay supine on the grass while his mother continued to smile gently at neither of her present children. i recall so clearly these miniatiae probably because i was to check my impressions so thoroughly only a few minutes later and besides, something in me had been on guard ever since that awful night in beardsley. i now refused to be diverted by the feeling of wellbeing that my walk had engenderedby the young summer breeze that enveloped the nape of my neck, the giving crrunch of the damn gravel, the juice tidbit. i had sucked out at last from a hollowy tooth, and even the comfortable weight of my provisions which the general condition of my heart should not have allowed me to carry but even that miserable pump of mine seemed to be working sweetly, and i felt          adolori damoureuse langueur, to quote dear old ronsard, as i reached the cottage where i had left my dolores.         to my surprise i found her dressed. she was sitting on the edge of the bed in slacks and tshirt, and was looking at me as if she could not quite place me. the frank soft shape of her small breasts was brought out rather than blurred by the limpness of her thin shirt, and this frankness irritated me. she had not washed yet her mouth was freshly though smudgily painted, and her broad teeth glistened like winetinged ivory, or pinkish poker chips. and there she sat, hands clasped in her lap, and dreamily brimmed with a diabolical glow that had no relations to me whatever.         i plumped down my heavy paper bag and stood staring at the bare ankles of her sandaled feet, then at her silly face, then again at her sinful feet. youve been out, i said the sandals were filthy with gravel.         i just got up, she replied, and added upon intercepting my downward glance went out for a sec. wanted to see if you were coming back.         she became aware of the bananas and uncoiled herself tableward.         what special suspicion could i have none indeedbut those muddy, moony eyes of hers, that singular warmth emanating from her i said nothing. i looked at the road meandering so distinctly within the frame of the window anybody wishing to betray my trust would have found it a splendid lookout. with rising appetite, lo applied herself to the fruit. all at once i remembered the ingratiating grin of the johnny next door. i stepped out quickly. all cars had disappeared except his station wagon his pregnant young wife was not getting into it with her baby and the other, more or less canceled, child.         whats the matter, where are you going cried lo from the porch.         i said nothing. i pushed her softness back into the room and went in after her. i ripped her shirt off. i unzipped the rest of her, i tore off her sandals. wildly, i pursued the shadow of her infidelity but the scent i traveled upon was so slight as to be practically undistinguishable from a madmans fancy.                                                      grosgaston, in his prissy way, had liked to make presentspresents just a prissy wee bit out of the ordinary, or so he prissily thought. noticing one night that my box of chessmen was broken, he sent me next morning, with a little lad of his, a copper case it had an elaborate oriental design over the lid and could be securely locked. once glance sufficed to assure me that it was one of those cheap money boxes called for some reason luizettas that you buy in algiers and elsewhere, and wonder what to do with afterwards. it turned out to be much too flat for holding my bulky chessmen, but i kept itusing it for a totally different purpose.         in order to break some pattern of fate in which i obscurely felt myself being enmeshed, i had decideddespite los visible annoyanceto spend another night at chestnut court definitely waking up at four in the morning, i ascertained that lo was still sound asleep mouth open, in a kind of dull amazement at the curiously inane life we all had rigged up for her and satisfied myself that the precious contents of the luizetta were safe. there, snugly wrapped in a white woolen scarf, lay a pocket automatic caliber ., capacity of magazine  cartridges, length a little under one ninth of lolitas length, stock checked walnut, finish full blued. i had inherited it from the late harold haze, with a  catalog which cheerily said in part particularly well adapted for use in the home and car as well as on the person. there it lay, ready for instant service on the person or persons, loaded and fully cocked with the slide lock in safety position, thus precluding any accidental discharge. we must remember that a pistol is the freudian symbol of the urfathers central forelimb.         i was now glad i had it with meand even more glad that i had learned to use it two years before, in the pine forest around my and charlottes glass lake. farlow, with whom i had roamed those remote woods, was an admirable marksman, and with his . actually managed to hit a hummingbird, though i must say not much of it could be retrieved for proofonly a little iridescent fluff. a burley expoliceman called krestovski, who in the twenties had shot and killed two escaped convicts, joined us and bagged a tiny woodpeckercompletely out of season, incidentally. between those two sportsmen i of course was a novice and kept missing everything, though i did would a squirrel on a later occasion when i went out alone. you like here, i whispered to my lightweight compact little chum, and then toasted it with a dram of gin.                                             the reader must now forget chestnuts and colts, and accompany us further west. the following days were marked by a number of great thunderstormsor perhaps, thee was but one single storm which progressed across country in ponderous frogleaps and which we could not shake off just as we could not shake off detective trapp for it was during those days that the problem of the aztec red convertible presented itself to me, and quite overshadowed the theme of los lovers.         queer i who was jealous of every male we metqueer, how i misinterpreted the designations of doom. perhaps i had been lulled by los modest behavior in winter, and anyway it would have been too foolish even for a lunatic to suppose another humbert was avidly following humbert and humberts nymphet with jovian fireworks, over the great and ugly plains. i surmised,          donc, that the red yak keeping behind us at a discreet distance mile after mile was operated by a detective whom some busybody had hired to see what exactly humbert humbert was doing with that minor stepdaughter of his. as happens with me at periods of electrical disturbance and crepitating lightnings, i had hallucinations. maybe they were more than hallucinations. i do not know what she or he, or both had put into my liquor but one night i felt sure somebody was tapping on the door of our cabin, and i flung it open, and noticed two thingsthat i was stark naked and that, whiteglistening in the raindripping darkness, there stood a man holding before his face the mask of jutting chin, a grotesque sleuth in the funnies. he emitted a muffled guffaw and scurried away, and i reeled back into the room, and fell asleep again, and am not sure even to this day that the visit was not a drugprovoked dream i have thoroughly studied trapps type of humor, and this might have been a plausible sample. oh, crude and absolutely ruthless somebody, i imagined, was making money on those masks of popular monsters and morons. did i see next morning two urchins rummaging in a garbage can and trying on jutting chin i wonder. it may all have been a coincidencedue to atmospheric conditions, i suppose.         being a murderer with a sensational but incomplete and unorthodox memory, i cannot tell you, ladies and gentlemen, the exact day when i first knew with utter certainty that the red convertible was following us. i do remember, however, the first time i saw its driver quite clearly. i was proceeding slowly one afternoon through torrents of rain and kept seeing that red ghost swimming and shivering with lust in my mirror, when presently the deluge dwindled to a patter, and then was suspended altogether. with a swishing sound a sunburst swept the highway, and needing a pair of new sunglasses, i pussled up at a filling station. what was happening was a sickness, a cancer, that could not be helped, so i simply ignored the fact that our quiet pursuer, in his converted state, stopped a little behind us at a cafe or bar bearing the idiotic sign the bustle a deceitful seatful. having seen to the needs of my car, i walked into the office to get those glasses and pay for the gas. as i was in the act of signing a travelers check and wondered about my exact whereabouts, i happened to glance through a side window, and saw a terrible thing. a broadbacked man, baldish, in an oatmeal coat and darkbrown trousers, was listening to lo who was leaning out of the car and talking to him very rapidly, her hand with outspread fingers going up and down as it did when she was very serious and emphatic. what struck me with sickening force washow should i put itthe voluble familiarity of her way, as if they had known each otheroh, for weeks and weeks. i saw him scratch his cheek and nod, and turn, and walk back to his convertible, a broad and thickish man of my age, somewhat resembling gustave trapp, a cousin of my fathers in switzerlandsame smoothly tanned face, fuller than mine, with a small dark mustache and a rosebud degenerate mouth. lolita was studying a road map when i got back into the car.         what did that man ask you, lol         man oh, that man. oh yes. oh, i dont know. he wondered if i had a map. lost his way, i guess.         we drove on, and i said         now listen, lo. i do not know whether you are lying or not, and i do not know whether you are insane or not, and i do not care for the moment but that person has been following us all day, and his car was at the motel yesterday, and i think he is a cop. you know perfectly well what will happen and where you will go if the police find out about things. now i want to know exactly what he said to you and what you told him.         she laughed.         if hes really a cop, she said shrilly but not illogically, the worst thing we could do, would be to show him we are scared. ignore him,          dad.         did he ask where we were going         oh, he knows          that mocking me.         anyway, i said, giving up, i have seen his face now. he is not pretty. he looks exactly like a relative of mine called trapp.         perhaps he is trapp. if i were youoh, look, all the nines are changing into the next thousand. when i was a little kid, she continued unexpectedly, i used to think theyd stop and go back to nines, if only my mother agreed to put the car in reverse.         it was the first time, i think, she spoke spontaneously of her prehumbertian childhood perhaps, the theatre had taught her that trick and silently we traveled on, unpursued.         but next day, like pain in a fatal disease that comes back as the drug and hope wear off, there it was again behind us, that glossy red beast. the traffic on the highway was light that day nobody passed anybody and nobody attempted to get in between our humble blue car and its imperious red shadowas if there were some spell cast on that interspace, a zone of evil mirth and magic, a zone whose very precision and stability had a glasslike virtue that was almost artistic. the driver behind me, with his stuffed shoulders and trappish mustache, looked like a display dummy, and his convertible seemed to move only because an invisible rope of silent silk connected it with out shabby vehicle. we were many times weaker than his splendid, lacquered machine, so that i did not even attempt to outspeed him.          o lente currite noctis equio softly run, nightmares we climbed long grades and rolled downhill again, and heeded speed limits, and spared slow children, and reproduced in sweeping terms the black wiggles of curves on their yellow shields, and no matter how and where we drove, the enchanted interspace slid on intact, mathematical, miragelike, the viatic counterpart of a magic carpet. and all the time i was aware of a private blaze on my right her joyful eye, her flaming cheek.         a traffic policeman, deep in the nightmare of crisscross streetsat halfpastfour p.m. in a factory townwas the hand of chance that interrupted the spell. he beckoned me on, and then with the same hand cut off my shadow. a score of cars were launched in between us, and i sped on, and deftly turned into a narrow lane. a sparrow alighted with a jumbo bread crumb, was tackled by another, and lost the crumb.         when after a few grim stoppages and a bit of deliberate meandering, i returned to the highway, our shadow had disappeared.         lola snorted and said if he is what you think he is, how silly to give him the slip.         i have other notions by now, i said.         you shouldahcheck them byahkeeping in touch with him, fahther deah, said lo, writhing in the coils of her own sarcasm. gee, you          aremean, she added in her ordinary voice.         we spent a grim night in a very foul cabin, under a sonorous amplitude of rain, and with a kind of prehistorically loud thunder incessantly rolling above us.         i am not a lady and do not like lightning, said lo, whose dread of electric storms gave me some pathetic solace.         we had breakfast in the township of soda, pop. .         judging by the terminal figure, i remarked, fatface is already here.         your humor, said lo, is sidesplitting, deah fahther.         we were in sagebrush country by that time, and there was a day or two of lovely release i had been a fool, all was well, that discomfort was merely a trapped flatus, and presently the mesas gave way to real mountains, and, on time, we drove into wace.         oh, disaster. some confusion had occurred, she had misread a date in the tour book, and the magic cave ceremonies were over she took it bravely, i must admitand, when we discovered there was in jurortish wace a summer theatre in full swing, we naturally drifted toward it one fair midjune evening. i really could not tell you the plot of the play we saw. a trivial affair, no doubt, with selfconscious light effects and a mediocre leading lady. the only detail that pleased me was a garland of seven little graces, more or less immobile, prettily painted, barelimbedseven bemused pubescent girls in colored gauze that had been recruited locally judging by the partisan flurry here and there among the audience and were supposed to represent a living rainbow, which lingered throughout the last act, and rather teasingly faded behind a series of multiplied veils. i remember thinking that this idea of childrencolors had been lifted by authors clare quilty and vivian darkbloom from a passage in james joyce, and that two of the colors were quite exasperatingly lovelyorange who kept fidgeting all the time, and emerald who, when her eyes got used to the pitchblack pit where we all heavily sat, suddenly smiled at her mother or her protector.         as soon as the thing was over, and manual applausea sound my nerves cannot standbegan to crash all around me, i started to pull and push lo toward the exit, in my so natural amorous impatience to get her back to our neonblue cottage in the stunned, starry night i always say nature is stunned by the sights she sees. dollylo, however, lagged behind, in a rosy daze, her pleased eyes narrowed, her sense of vision swamping the rest of her senses to such an extent that her limp hands hardly came together at all in the mechanical action of clapping they still went through. i had seen that kind of thing in children before but, by god, this was a special child, myopically beaming at the already remote stage where i glimpsed something of the joint authorsa mans tuxedo and the bare shoulders of a hawklike, blackhaired, strikingly tall woman.         youve again hurt my wrist, you brute, said lolita in a small voice as she slipped into her car seat.         i am dreadfully sorry, my darling, my own ultraviolet darling, i said, unsuccessfully trying to catch her elbow, and i added, to change the conversationto change the direction of fate, oh god, oh god vivian is quite a woman. i am sure we saw her yesterday in that restaurant, in soda pop.         sometimes, said lo, you are quite revoltingly dumb. first, vivian is the male author, the gal author is clare and second, she is forty, married and has negro blood.         i thought, i said kidding her, quilty was an ancient flame of yours, in the days when you loved me, in sweet old ramsdale.         what countered lo, her features working. that fat dentist you must be confusing me with some other fast little article.         and i thought to myself how those fast little articles forget everything, everything, while we, old lovers, treasure every inch of their nymphancy.                                             with los knowledge and assent, the two post offices given to the beardsley postmaster as forwarding addresses were p.o. wace and p.o. elphinstone. next morning we visited the former and had to wait in a short but slow queue. serene lo studied the rogues gallery. handsome bryan bryanski, alias anthony bryan, alias tony brown, eyes hazel, complexion fair, was wanted for kidnapping. a sadeyed old gentlemans fauxpas was mail fraud, and, as if that were not enough, he was cursed with deformed arches. sullen sullivan came with a caution is believed armed, and should be considered extremely dangerous. if you want to make a movie out of my book, have one of these faces gently melt into my own, while i look. and moreover there was a smudgy snapshot of a missing girl, age fourteen, wearing brown shoes when last seen, rhymes. please notify sheriff buller.         i forget my letters as to dollys, there was her report and a very speciallooking envelope. this i deliberately opened and perused its contents. i concluded i was doing the foreseen since she did not seem to mind and drifted toward the newsstand near the exit.         dollylo well, the play was a grand success. all three hounds lay quiet having been slightly drugged by cutler, i suspect, and linda knew all your lines. she was fine, she had alertness and control, but lacked somehow the          responsiveness,the          relaxed vitality,the charm of          myand the authorsdiana but there was no author to applaud us as last time, and the terrific electric storm outside interfered with our own modest offstage thunder. oh dear, life does fly. now that everything is over, school, play, the roy mess, mothers confinement our baby, alas, did not live, it all seems such a long time ago, though practically i still bear traces of the paint.         we are going to new york after tomorrow, and i guess i cant manage to wriggle out of accompanying my parents to europe. i have even worse news for you. dollylo i may not be back at beardsley if and when you return. with one thing and another, one being you know who, and the other not being who you think you know, dad wants me to go to school in paris for one year while he and fullbright are around.         as expected, poor poet stumbled in scene iii when arriving at the bit of french nonsense. remember          ne manque pas de dire ton amant, chimne, comme le lac         est         beau car il faut quil ty mne.lucky beau          quil tywhat a tonguetwister well, be good, lollikins. best love from your poet, and best regards to the governor. your mona. p.s. because of one thing and another, my correspondence happens to be rigidly controlled. so better wait till i write you from europe. she never did as far as i know. the letter contained an element of mysterious nastiness that i am too tired today to analyze. i found it later preserved in one of the tour books, and give it here          titre documentaire. i read it twice.         i looked up from the letter and was about tothere was no lo to behold. while i was engrossed in monas witchery, lo had shrugged her shoulders and vanished. did you happen to see i asked of a hunchback sweeping the floor near the entrance. he had, the old lecherer. he guessed she had seen a friend and had hurried out. i hurried out too. i stoppedshe had not. i hurried on. i stopped again. it had happened at last. she had gone for ever.         in later years i have often wondered why she did          notgo forever that day. was it the retentive quality of her new summer clothes in my locked car was it some unripe particle in some general plan was it simply because, all things considered, i might as well be used to convey her to elphinstonethe secret terminus, anyway i only know i was quite certain she had left me for ever. the noncommittal mauve mountains half encircling the town seemed to me to swarm with panting, scrambling, laughing, panting lolitas who dissolved in their haze. a big w made of white stones on a steep talus in the far vista of a cross street seemed the very initial of woe.         the new and beautiful post office i had just emerged from stood between a dormant movie house and a conspiracy of poplars. the time was  a.m. mountain time. the street was charming it into beauty, was one of those fragile young summer mornings with flashes of glass here and there and a general air of faltering and almost fainting at the prospect of an intolerably torrid noon. crossing over, i loafed and leafed, as it were, through one long block drugs, real estate, fashions, auto parts, cafe, sporting goods, real estate, furniture, appliances, western union, cleaners, grocery. officer, officer, my daughter has run away. in collusion with a detective in love with a blackmailer. took advantage of my utter helplessness. i peered into all the stores. i deliberated inly if i should talk to any of the sparse footpassengers. i did not. i sat for a while in the parked car. i inspected the public garden on the east side. i went back to fashions and auto parts. i told myself with a burst of furious sarcasm          un ricanementthat i was crazy to suspect her, that she would turn up any minute.         she did.         i wheeled around and shook off the hand she had placed on my sleeve with a timid and imbecile smile.         get into the car, i said.         she obeyed, and i went on pacing up and down, struggling with nameless thoughts, trying to plan some way of tackling her duplicity.         presently she left the car and was at my side again. my sense of hearing gradually got tuned in to station lo again, and i became aware she was telling me that she had met a former girl friend.         yes whom         a beardsley girl.         good. i now every name in your group. alice adams         the girl was not in my group.         good. i have a complete student list with me. her name please.         she was not in my school she is just a town girl in beardsley.         good. i have the beardsley directory with me too. well look up all the browns.         i only know her first name.         mary or jane         nodolly, like me.         so thats the dead end the mirror you break your nose against. good. let us try another angle. you have been absent twentyeight minutes. what did the two dollys do         we went to a drugstore.         and you had there         oh, just a couple of cokes.         careful, dolly. we can check that, you know.         at least, she had. i had a glass of water.         good. was it that place there         sure.         good, come on, well grill the soda jerk.         wait a sec. come to think it might have been further downjust around the corner.         come on all the same. go in please. well, lets see. opening a chained telephone book. dignified funeral service. no, not yet. here we are druggistsretail. hill drug store. larkins pharmacy. and two more. thats all wace seems to have in the way of soda fountainsat least in the business section. well, we will check them all.         go to hell, she said.         lo, rudeness will get you nowhere.         okay, she said. but youre not going to trap me. okay, so we did not have a pop. we just talked and looked at dresses in show windows.         which that window there for example         yes, that one there, for example.         oh lo lets look closer at it.         it was indeed a pretty sight. a dapper young fellow was vacuumcleaning a carpet upon which stood two figures that looked as if some blast had just worked havoc with them. one figure was stark naked, wigless and armless. its comparatively small stature and smirking pose suggested that when clothed it had represented, and would represent when clothed again, a girlchild of lolitas size. but in its present state it was sexless. next to it, stood a much taller veiled bride, quite perfect and          intactaexcept for the lack of one arm. on the floor, at the feet of these damsels, where the man crawled about laboriously with his cleaner, there lay a cluster of three slender arms, and a blond wig. two of the arms happened to be twisted and seemed to suggest a clasping gesture of horror and supplication.         look, lo, i said quietly. look well. is not that a rather good symbol of something or other howeveri went on as we got back into the cari have taken certain precautions. here delicately opening the glove compartment, on this pad i have our boy friends car number.         as the ass i was i had not memorized it. what remained of it in my mind were the initial letter and the closing figure as if the whole amphitheater of six signs receded concavely behind a tinted glass too opaque to allow the central series to be deciphered, but just translucent enough to make out its extreme edgesa capital p and a . i have to go into those details which in themselves can interest only a professional psychologue because otherwise the reader ah, if i could visualize him as a blondbearded scholar with rosy lips sucking          la pomme de sa canneas he quaffs my manuscript might not understand the quality of the shock i experienced upon noticing that the p had acquired the bustle of a b and that the  had been deleted altogether. the rest, with erasures revealing the hurried shuttle smear of a pencils rubber end, and with parts of numbers obliterated or reconstructed in a childs hand, presented a tangle of barbed wire to any logical interpretation. all i knew was the stateone adjacent to the state beardsley was in.         i said nothing. i put the pad back, closed the compartment, and drove out of wace. lo had grabbed some comics from the back seat and, mobilewhitebloused, one brown elbow out of the window, was deep in the current adventure of some clout or clown. three or four miles out of wace, i turned into the shadow of a picnic ground where the morning had dumped its litter of light on an empty table lo looked up with a semismile of surprise and without a word i delivered a tremendous backhand cut that caught her smack on her hot hard little cheekbone.         and then the remorse, the poignant sweetness of sobbing atonement, groveling love, the hopelessness of sensual reconciliation. in the velvet night, at mirana motel mirana i kissed the yellowish soles of her longtoed feet, i immolated myself but it was all of no avail. both doomed were we. and soon i was to enter a new cycle of persecution.         in a street of wace, on its outskirts oh, i am quite sure it was not a delusion. in a street of wace, i had glimpsed the aztec red convertible, or its identical twin. instead of trapp, it contained four or five loud young people of several sexesbut i said nothing. after wace a totally new situation arose. for a day or two, i enjoyed the mental emphasis with which i told myself that we were not, and never had been followed and then i became sickeningly conscious that trapp had changed his tactics and was still with us, in this or that rented car.         a veritable proteus of the highway, with bewildering ease he switched from one vehicle to another. this technique implied the existence of garages specializing in stageautomobile operations, but i never could discover the remises he used. he seemed to patronize at first the chevrolet genus, beginning with a campus cream convertible, then going on to a small horizon blue sedan, and thenceforth fading into surf gray and driftwood gray. then he turned to other makes and passed through a pale dull rainbow of paint shades, and one day i found myself attempting to cope with the subtle distinction between our own dream blue melmoth and the crest blue oldsmobile he had rented grays, however, remained his favorite cryptochromism, and, in agonizing nightmares, i tried in vain to sort out properly such ghosts as chryslers shell gray, chevrolets thistle gray, dodges french gray         the necessity of being constantly on the lookout for his little mustache and open shirtor for his baldish pate and broad shouldersled me to a profound study of all cars on the roadbehind, before, alongside, coming, going, every vehicle under the dancing sun the quiet vacationists automobile with the box of tendertouch tissues in the back window the recklessly speeding jalopy full of pale children with a shaggy dogs head protruding, and a crumpled mudguard the bachelors tudor sedan crowded with suits on hangers the huge fat house trailer weaving in front, immune to the indian file of fury boiling behind it the car with the young female passenger politely perched in the middle of the front seat to be closer to the young male driver the car carrying on its roof a red boat bottom up the gray car slowing up before us, the gray car catching up with us.         we were in mountain country, somewhere between snow and champion, and rolling down an almost imperceptible grade, when i had my next distinct view of detective paramour trapp. the gray mist behind us had deepened and concentrated into the compactness of a dominion blue sedan. all of a sudden, as if the car i drove responded to my poor hearts pangs, we were slithering from side to side, with something making a helpless plapplapplap under us.         you got a flat, mister, said cheerful lo.         i pulled upnear a precipice. she folded her arms and put her foot on the dashboard. i got out and examined the right rear wheel. the base of its tire was sheepishly and hideously square. trapp had stopped some fifty yards behind us. his distant face formed a grease spot of mirth. this was my chance. i started to walk towards himwith the brilliant idea of asking him for a jack through i had one. he backed a little. i stubbed my toe against a stoneand there was a sense of general laughter. then a tremendous truck loomed from behind trapp and thundered by meand immediately after, i heard it utter a convulsive honk. instinctively i looked backand saw my own car gently creeping away. i could make out lo ludicrously at the wheel, and the engine was certainly runningthough i remembered i had cut it but had not applied the emergency brake and during the brief space of throbtime that it took me to reach the croaking machine which came to a standstill at last, it dawned upon me that during the last two years little lo had had ample time to pick up the rudiments of driving. as i wrenched the door open, i was goddam sure she had started the car to prevent me from walking up to trapp. her trick proved useless, however, for even while i was puruing her he had made an energetic uturn and was gone. i rested for a while. lo asked wasnt i going to thank herthe car had started to move by itself andgetting no answer, she immersed herself in a study of the map. i got out again and commenced the ordeal of the orb, as charlotte used to say. perhaps, i was losing my mind.         we continued our grotesque journey. after a forlorn and useless dip, we went up and up. on a steep grade i found myself behind the gigantic truck that had overtaken us. it was now groaning up a winding road and was impossible to pass. out of its front part a small oblong of smooth silverthe inner wrapping of chewing gumescaped and flew back into our windshield. it occurred to me that if i were really losing my mind, i might end by murdering somebody. in factsaid highanddry humbert to floundering humbertit might be quite clever to prepare thingsto transfer the weapon from box to pocketso as to be ready to take advantage of the spell of insanity when it does come.                                             by permitting lolita to study acting i had, fond fool, suffered her to cultivate deceit. it now appeared that it had not been merely a matter of learning the answers to such questions as what is the basic conflict in hedda gabler, or where are the climaxes in love under the lindens, or analyze the prevailing mood of cherry orchard it was really a matter of learning to betray me. how i deplored now the exercises in sensual simulation that i had so often seen her go through in our beardsley parlor when i would observe her from some strategic point while she, like a hypnotic subject of a performer in a mystic rite, produced sophisticated version of infantile makebelieve by going through the mimetic actions of hearing a moan in the dark, seeing for the first time a brand new young stepmother, tasting something she hated, such as buttermilk, smelling crushed grass in a lush orchard, or touching mirages of objects with her sly, slender, girlchild hands. among my papers i still have a mimeographed sheet suggesting         tactile drill. imagine yourself picking up and holding a pingpong ball, an apple, a sticky date, a new flannelfluffed tennis ball, a hot potato, an ice cube, a kitten, a puppy, a horseshoe, a feather, a flashlight.         knead with your fingers the following imaginary things a piece of brad, india rubber, a friends aching temple, a sample of velvet, a rose petal.         you are a blind girl. palpate the face of a greek youth, cyrano, santa claus, a baby, a laughing faun, a sleeping stranger, your father.         but she had been so pretty in the weaving of those delicate spells, in the dreamy performance of her enchantments and duties on certain adventurous evenings, in beardsley, i also had her dance for me with the promise of some treat or gift, and although these routine legparted leaps of hers were more like those of a football cheerleader than like the languorous and jerky motions of a parisian          petit rat, the rhythms of her not quite nubile limbs had given me pleasure. but all that was nothing, absolutely nothing, to the indescribable itch of rapture that her tennis game produced in methe teasing delirious feeling of teetering on the very brink of unearthly order and splendor.         despite her advanced age, she was more of a nymphet than ever, with her apricotcolored limbs, in her subteen tennis togs winged gentlemen no hereafter is acceptable if it does not produce her as she was then, in that colorado resort between snow and elphinstone, with everything right the white wide littleboy shorts, the slender waist, the apricot midriff, the white breastkerchief whose ribbons went up and encircled her neck to end behind in a dangling knot leaving bare her gaspingly young and adorable apricot shoulder blades with that pubescence and those lovely gentle bones, and the smooth, downwardtapering back. her cap had a white peak. her racket had cost me a small fortune. idiot, triple idiot i could have filmed her i would have had her now with me, before my eyes, in the projection room of my pain and despair         she would wait and relax for a bar or two of whitelined time before going into the act of serving, and often bounced the ball once or twice, or pawed the ground a little, always at ease, always rather vague about the score, always cheerful as she so seldom was in the dark life she led at home. her tennis was the highest point to which i can imagine a young creature bringing the art of makebelieve, although i dareseay, for her it was the very geometry of basic reality.         the exquisite clarity of all her movements had its auditory counterpart in the pure ringing sound of her every stroke. the ball when it entered her aura of control became somehow whiter, its resilience somehow richer, and the instrument of precision she used upon it seemed inordinately prehensile and deliberate at the moment of clinging contact. her form was, indeed, an absolutely perfect imitation of absolutely topnotch tenniswithout any utilitarian results. as edusas sister, electra gold, a marvelous young coach, said to me once while i sat on a pulsating hard bench watching dolores haze toying with linda hall and being beaten by her dolly has a magnet in the center of her racket guts, but why the heck is she so polite ah, electra, what did it matter, with such grace i remember at the very first game i watched being drenched with an almost painful convulsion of beauty assimilation. my lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at the ample and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop and hang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot, pristine armpit, burnished arm and far backflung racket, as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at the small globe suspended so high in the zenith of the powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of falling upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip.         it had, that serve of hers, beauty, directness, youth, a classical purity of trajectory, and was, despite its spanking pace, fairly easy to return, having as it did no twist or sting to its long elegant hop.         that i could have had all her strokes, all her enchantments, immortalized in segments of celluloid, makes me moan today with frustration. they would have been so much more than the snapshots i burned her overhead volley was related to her service as the envoy is to the ballade for she had been trained, my pet, to patter up at once to the net on her nimble, vivid, whiteshod feet. there was nothing to choose between her forehand and backhand drives they were mirror images of one anothermy very loins still tingle with those pistol reports repeated by crisp echoes and electras cries. one of the pearls of dollys game was a short halfvolley that ned litam had taught her in california.         she preferred acting to swimming, and swimming to tennis yet i insist that had not something within her been broken by menot that i realized it thenshe would have had on the top of her perfect form the will to win, and would have become a real girl champion. dolores, with two rackets under her arm, in wimbledon. dolores endorsing a dromedary. dolores turning professional. dolores acting a girl champion in a movie. dolores and her gray, humble, hushed husbandcoach, old humbert.         there was nothing wrong or deceitful in the spirit of her gameunless one considered her cheerful indifference toward its outcome as the feint of a nymphet. she who was so cruel and crafty in everyday life, revealed an innocence, a frankness, a kindness of ballplacing, that permitted a secondrate but determined player, no matter how uncouth and incompetent, to poke and cut his way to victory. despite her small stature, she covered the one thousand and fiftythree square feet of her half of the court with wonderful ease, once she had entered into the rhythm of a rally and as long as she could direct that rhythm but any abrupt attack, or sudden change of tactics on her adversarys part, left her helpless. at match point, her second serve, whichrather typicallywas even stronger and more stylish than her first for she had none of the inhibitions that cautious winners have, would strike vibrantly the hardcord of the netand ricochet out of court. the polished gem of her dropshot was snapped up and put away by an opponent who seemed fourlegged and wielded a crooked paddle. her dramatic drives and lovely volleys would candidly fall at his feet. over and over again she would land an easy one into the netand merrily mimic dismay by drooping in a ballet attitude, with her forelocks hanging. so sterile were her grace and whipper that she could not even win from panting me and my oldfashioned lifting drive.         i suppose i am especially susceptible to the magic of games. in my chess sessions with gaston i saw the board as a square pool of limpid water with rare shells and stratagems rosily visible upon the smooth tessellated bottom, which to my confused adversary was all ooze and squidcloud. similarly, the initial tennis coaching i had inflicted on lolitaprior to the revelations that came to her through the great californians lessonsremained in my mind as oppressive and distressful memoriesnot only because she had been so hopelessly and irritatingly irritated by every suggestion of minebut because the precious symmetry of the court instead of reflecting the harmonies latent in her was utterly jumbled by the clumsiness and lassitude of the resentful child i mistaught. now things were different, and on that particular day, in the pure air of champion, colorado, on that admirable court at the foot of seep stone stairs leading up to champion hotel where we had spent the night, i felt i could rest from the nightmare of unknown betrayals within the innocence of her style, of her soul, of her essential grace.         she was hitting hard and flat, with her usual effortless sweep, feeding me deep skimming ballsall so rhythmically coordinated and overt as to reduce my footwork to, practically, a swinging strollcrack players will understand what i mean. my rather heavily cut serve that i had been taught by my father who had learned it from decugis or borman, old friends of his and great champions, would have seriously troubled my lo, had i really tried to trouble her. but who would upset such a lucid dear did i ever mention that her bare arm bore the  of vaccination that i loved her hopelessly that she was only fourteen         an inquisitive butterfly passed, dipping, between us.         two people in tennis shorts, a redhaired fellow only about eight years my junior, and an indolent dark girl with a moody mouth and hard eyes, about two years lolitas senior, appeared from nowhere. as is common with dutiful tyros, their rackets were sheathed and framed, and they carried them not as if they were the natural and comfortable extensions of certain specialized muscles, but hammers or blunderbusses or whimbles, or my own dreadful cumbersome sins. rather unceremoniously seating themselves near my precious coat, on a bench adjacent to the court, they fell to admiring very vocally a rally of some fifty exchanges that lo innocently helped me to foster and upholduntil there occurred a syncope in the series causing her to gasp as her overhead smash went out of court, whereupon she melted into winsome merriment, my golden pet.         i felt thirsty by then, and walked to the drinking fountain there red approached me and in all humility suggested a mixed double. i am bill mead, he said. and thats fay page, actress. maffy on sayhe added pointing with his ridiculously hooded racket at polished fay who was already talking to dolly. i was about to reply sorry, but for i hate to have my filly involved in the chops and jabs of cheap bunglers, when a remarkably melodious cry diverted my attention a bellboy was tripping down the steps from the hotel to our court and making me signs. i was wanted, if you please, on an urgent long distance callso urgent in fact that the line was being held for me. certainly. i got into my coat inside pocket heavy with pistol and told lo i would be back in a minute. she was picking up a ballin the continental footracket way which was one of the few nice things i had taught her,and smiledshe smiled at me         an awful calm kept my heart afloat as i followed the boy up to the hotel. this, to use an american term, in which discovery, retribution, torture, death, eternity appear in the shape of a singularly repulsive nutshell, was          it. i had left her in mediocre hands, but it hardly mattered now. i would fight, of course. oh, i would fight. better destroy everything than surrender her. yes, quite a climb.         at the desk, dignified, romannosed man, with, i suggest, a very obscure past that might reward investigation, handed me a message in his own hand. the line had not been held after all. the note said         mr. humbert. the head of birdsley sic school called. summer residencebirdsley . please call back immediately. highly important.         i folded myself into a booth, took a little pill, and four about twenty minutes tussled with spacespooks. a quartet of propositions gradually became audible soprano, there was no such number in beardsley alto, miss pratt was on her way to england tenor, beardsley school had not telephoned bass, they could not have done so, since nobody knew i was, that particular day, in champion, colo. upon my stinging him, the roman took the trouble to find out if there had been a long distance call. there had been none. a fake call from some local dial was not excluded. i thanked him. he said you bet. after a visit to the purling mens room and a stiff drink at the bar, i started on my return march. from the very first terrace i saw, far below, on the tennis court which seemed the size of a school childs illwiped slate, golden lolita playing in a double. she moved like a fair angel among three horrible boschian cripples. one of these, her partner, while changing sides, jocosely slapped her on her behind with his racket. he had a remarkably round head and wore incongruous brown trousers. there was a momentary flurryhe saw me, and throwing away his racketminescuttled up the slope. he waved his wrists and elbows in a wouldbe comical imitation of rudimentary wings, as he climbed, blowlegged, to the street, where his gray car awaited him. next moment he and the grayness were gone. when i came down, the remaining trio were collecting and sorting out the balls.         mr. mead, who was that person         bill and fay, both looking very solemn, shook their heads.         that absurd intruder had butted in to make up a double, hadnt he, dolly         dolly. the handle of my racket was still disgustingly warm. before returning to the hotel, i ushered her into a little alley halfsmothered in fragrant shrubs, with flowers like smoke, and was about to burst into ripe sobs and plead with her imperturbed dream in the most abject manner for clarification, no matter how meretricious, of the slow awfulness enveloping me, when we found ourselves behind the convulsed mead twosomeassorted people, you know, meeting among idyllic settings in old comedies. bill and fay were both weak with laughterwe had come at the end of their private joke. it did not really matter.         speaking as if it really did not really matter, and assuming, apparently, that life was automatically rolling on with all its routine pleasures, lolita said she would like to change into her bathing things, and spend the rest of the afternoon at the swimming pool. it was a gorgeous day. lolita                                             lo lola lolita i hear myself crying from a doorway into the sun, with the acoustics of time, domed time, endowing my call and its telltale hoarseness with such a wealth of anxiety, passion and pain that really it would have been instrumental in wrenching open the zipper of her nylon shroud had she been dead. lolita in the middle of a trim turfed terrace i found her at lastshe had run out before i was ready. oh lolita there she was playing with a damned dog, not me. the animal, a terrier of sorts, was losing and snapping up again and adjusting between his jaws a wet little red ball he took rapid chords with his front paws on the resilient turf, and then would bounce away. i had only wanted to see where she was, i could not swim with my heart in that state, but who caredand there she was, and there was i, in my robeand so i stopped calling but suddenly something in the pattern of her motions, as she dashed this way and that in her aztec red bathing briefs and bra, struck me there was an ecstasy, a madness about her frolics that was too much of a glad thing. even the dog seemed puzzled by the extravagance of her reactions. i put a gentle hand to my chest as i surveyed the situation. the turquoise blue swimming pool some distance behind the lawn was no longer behind that lawn, but within my thorax, and my organs swam in it like excrements in the blue sea water in nice. one of the bathers had left the pool and, halfconcealed by the peacocked shade of trees, stood quite still, holding the ends of the towel around his neck and following lolita with his amber eyes. there he stood, in the camouflage of sun and shade, disfigured by them and masked by his own nakedness, his damp black hair or what was left of it, glued to his round head, his little mustache a humid smear, the wool on his chest spread like a symmetrical trophy, his naval pulsating, his hirsute thighs dripping with bright droplets, his tight wet black bathing trunks bloated and bursting with vigor where his great fat bullybag was pulled up and back like a padded shield over his reversed beasthood. and as i looked at his oval nutbrown face, it dawned upon me that what i had recognized him by was the reflection of my daughters countenancethe same beatitude and grimace but made hideous by his maleness. and i also knew that the child, my child, knew he was looking, enjoyed the lechery of his look and was putting on a show of gambol and glee, the vile and beloved slut. as she made for the ball and missed it, she fell on her back, with her obscene young legs madly pedaling in the air i could sense the musk of her excitement from where i stood, and then i saw petrified with a kind of sacred disgust the man close his eyes and bare his small, horribly small and even, teeth as he leaned against a tree in which a multitude of dappled priaps shivered. immediately afterwards a marvelous transformation took place. he was no longer the satyr but a very goodnatured and foolish swiss cousin, the gustave trapp i have mentioned more than once, who used to counteract his sprees he drank beer with milk, the good swine by feats of weightliftingtottering and grunting on a lake beach with his otherwise very complete bathing suit jauntily stripped from one shoulder.          thistrapp noticed me from afar and working the towel on his name walked back with false insouciance to the pool. and as if the sun had gone out of the game, lo slackened and slowly got up ignoring the ball that the terrier placed before her. who can say what heartbreaks are caused in a dog by our discontinuing a romp i started to say something, and then sat down on the grass with a quite monstrous pain in my chest and vomited a torrent of browns and greens that i had never remembered eating.         i saw lolitas eyes, and they seemed to be more calculating than frightened. i heard her saying to a kind lady that her father was having a fit. then for a long time i lay in a lounge chair swallowing pony upon pony of gin. and next morning i felt strong enough to drive on which in later years no doctor believed.                                             the tworoom cabin we had ordered at silver spur court, elphinstone, turned out to belong to the glossily browned pinelog kind that lolita used to be so fond of in the days of our carefree first journey oh, how different things were now i am not referring to trapp or trapps. after allwell, really after all, gentlemen, it was becoming abundantly clear that all those identical detectives in prismatically changing cars were figments of my persecution mania, recurrent images based on coincidence and chance resemblance.          soyons         logiques, crowed the cocky gallic part of my brainand proceeded to rout the notion of a lolitamaddened salesman or comedy gangster, with stooges, persecuting me, and hoaxing me, and otherwise taking riotous advantage of my strange relations with the law. i remember humming my panic away. i remember evolving even an explanation of the birdsley telephone call but if i could dismiss trapp, as i had dismissed my convulsions on the lawn at champion, i could do nothing with the anguish of knowing lolita to be so tantalizingly, so miserably unattainable and beloved on the very even of a new era, when my alembics told me she should stop being a nymphet, stop torturing me.         an additional, abominable, and perfectly gratuitous worry was lovingly prepared for me in elphinstone. lo had been dull and silent during the last laptwo hundred mountainous miles uncontaminated by smokegray sleuths or zigzagging zanies. she hardly glanced at the famous, oddly shaped, splendidly flushed rock which jutted above the mountains and had been the takeoff for nirvana on the part of a temperamental show girl. the town was newly built, or rebuilt, on the flat floor of a seventhousandfoothigh valley it would soon bore lo, i hoped, and we would spin on to california, to the mexican border, to mythical bays, saguaro desserts, fatamorganas. jos lizzarrabengoa, as you remember, planned to take his carmen to the          etats unis.i conjured up a central american tennis competition in which dolores haze and various californian schoolgirl champions would dazzlingly participate. goodwill tours on that smiling level eliminate the distinction between passport and sport. why did i hope we would be happy abroad a change of environment is the traditional fallacy upon which doomed loves, and lungs, rely.         mrs. hays, the brisk, briskly rouged, blueeyed widow who ran the motor court, asked me if i were swiss perchance, because her sister had married a swiss ski instructor. i was, whereas my daughter happened to be half irish. i registered, hays gave me the key and a tinkling smile, and, still twinkling, showed me where to park the car lo crawled out and shivered a little the luminous evening air was decidedly crisp. upon entering the cabin, she sat down on a chair at a card table, buried her face in the crook of her arm and said she felt awful. shamming, i thought, shamming, no doubt, to evade my caresses i was passionately parched but she began to whimper in an unusually dreary way when i attempted to fondle her. lolita ill. lolita dying. her skin was scalding hot i took her temperature, orally, then looked up a scribbled formula i fortunately had in a jotter and after laboriously reducing the, meaningless to me, degrees fahrenheit to the intimate centigrade of my childhood, found she had ., which at least made sense. hysterical little nymphs might, i knew, run up all kinds of temperatureeven exceeding a fatal count. and i would have given her a sip of hot spiced wine, and two aspirins, and kissed the fever away, if, upon an examination of her lovely uvula, one of the gems of her body, i had not seen that it was a burning red. i undressed her. her breath was bittersweet. her brown rose tasted of blood. she was shaking from head to toe. she complained of a painful stiffness in the upper vertebraeand i thought of poliomyelitis as any american parent would. giving up all hope of intercourse, i wrapped her in a laprobe and carried her into the car. kind mrs. hays in the meantime had alerted the local doctor. you are lucky it happened here, she said for not only was blue the best man in the district, but the elphinstone hospital was as modern as modern could be, despite its limited capacity. with a heterosexual erlknig in pursuit, thither i drove, halfblinded by a royal sunset on the lowland side and guided by a little old woman, a portable witch, perhaps his daughter, whom mrs. haus had lent me, and whom i was never to see again. dr. blue, whose learning, no doubt, was infinitely inferior to his reputation, assured me it was a virus infection, and when i alluded to her comparatively recent flu, curtly said this was another bug, he had forty such cases on his hands all of which sounded like the ague of the ancients. i wondered if i should mention, with a casual chuckle, that my fifteenyearold daughter had had a minor accident while climbing an awkward fence with her boy friend, but knowing i was drunk, i decided to withhold the information till later if necessary. to an unsmiling blond bitch of a secretary i gave my daughters age as practically sixteen. while i was not looking, my child was taken away from me in vain i insisted i be allowed to spend the night on a welcome mat in a corner of their damned hospital. i ran up constructivistic flights of stairs, i tried to trace my darling so as to tell her she had better not babble, especially if she felt as lightheaded as we all did. at one point, i was rather dreadfully rude to a very young and very cheeky nurse with overdeveloped gluteal parts and blazing black eyesof basque descent, as i learned. her father was an imported shepherd, a trainer of sheep dogs. finally, i returned to the car and remained in it for i do not know how many hours, hunched up in the dark, stunned by my new solitude, looking out openmouthed now at the dimly illumined, very square and low hospital building squatting in the middle of its lawny block, now up at the wash of stars and the jagged silvery ramparts of the          haute montagnewhere at the moment marys father, lonely joseph lore was dreaming of oloron, lagore, rolas          que saisjeor seducing a ewe. suchlike fragrant vagabond thoughts have been always a solace to me in times of unusual stress, and only when, despite liberal libations, i felt fairly numbed by the endless night, did i think of driving back to the motel. the old woman had disappeared, and i was not quite sure of my way. wide gravel roads crisscrossed drowsy rectangual shadows. i made out what looked like the silhouette of gallows on what was probably a school playground and in another wastelike black there rose in domed silence the pale temple of some local sect. i found the highway at last, and then the motel, where millions of socalled millers, a kind of insect, were swarming around the neon contours of no vacancy and, when, at  a.m., after one of those untimely hot showers which like some mordant only help to fix a mans despair and weariness, i lay on her bed that smelled of chestnuts and roses, and peppermint, and the very delicate, very special french perfume i latterly allowed her to use, i found myself unable to assimilate the simple fact that for the first time in two years i was separated from my lolita. all at once it occurred to me that her illness was somehow the development of a themethat it had the same taste and tone as the series of linked impressions which had puzzled and tormented me during our journey i imagined that secret agent, or secret lover, or prankster, or hallucination, or whatever he was, prowling around the hospitaland aurora had hardly warmed her hands, as the pickers of lavender way in the country of my birth, when i found myself trying to get into that dungeon again, knocking upon its green doors, breakfastless, stoolless, in despair.         this was tuesday, and wednesday or thursday, splendidly reacting like the darling she was to some serum sparrows sperm or dugongs dung, she was much better, and the doctor said that in a couple of days she would be skipping again.         of the eight times i visited her, the last one alone remains sharply engraved on my mind. it had been a great feat to come for i felt all hollowed out by the infection that by then was at work on me too. none will know the strain it was to carry that bouquet, that load of love, those books that i had traveled sixty miles to buy brownings          dramatic works, the history of dancing, clowns and columbines, the russian ballet, flowers of the rockies, the theatre guild anthology, tennisby helen wills, who had won the national junior girl singles at the age of fifteen. as i was staggering up to the door of my daughters thirteendollara day private room, mary lore, the beastly young parttime nurse who had taken an unconcealed dislike to me, emerged with a finished breakfast tray, placed it with a quick crash on a chair in the corridor, and, fundament jigging, shot back into the roomprobably to warn her poor little dolores that the tyrannical old father was creeping up on crepe soles, with books and bouquet the latter i had composed of wild flowers and beautiful leaves gathered with my own gloved hands on a mountain pass at sunrise i hardly slept at all that fateful week.         feeding my carmencita well idly i glanced at the tray. on a yolkstained plate there was a crumpled envelope. it had contained something, since one edge was torn, but there was no address on itnothing at all, save a phony armorial design with ponderosa lodge in green letters thereupon i performed a          chasscroiswith mary, who was in the act of bustling out againwonderful how fast they move and how little they do, those rumpy young nurses. she glowered at the envelope i had put back, uncrumpled.         you better not touch, she said, nodding directionally. could burn your fingers.         below my dignity to rejoin. all i said was                   je croyais que ctait unbillnot a          billet doux. then, entering the sunny room, to lolita           bonjour, mon petit.         dolores, said mary lore, entering with me, past me, though me, the plump whore, and blinking, and starting to fold very rapidly a white flannel blanket as she blinked dolores, your pappy thinks you are getting letters from my boy friend. its me smugly tapping herself on the small glit cross she wore gets them. and my pappy can parlayvoo as well as yours.         she left the room. dolores, so rosy and russet, lips freshly painted, hair brilliantly brushed, bare arms straightened out on neat coverleat, lay innocently beaming at me or nothing. on the bed table, next to a paper napkin and a pencil, her topaz ring burned in the sun.         what gruesome funeral flowers, she said. thanks all the same. but do you mind very much cutting out the french it annoys everybody.         back at the usual rush came the ripe young hussy, reeking of urine and garlic, with the          desert news, which her fair patient eagerly accepted, ignoring the sumptuously illustrated volumes i had brought.         my sister ann, said marry topping information with afterthought, works at the ponderosa place.         poor bluebeard. those brutal brothers.          estce que tu ne maimes plus, ma carmenshe never had. at the moment i knew my love was as hopeless as everand i also knew the two girls were conspirators, plotting in basque, or zemfirian, against my hopeless love. i shall go further and say that lo was playing a double game since she was also fooling sentimental mary whom she had told, i suppose, that she wanted to dwell with her funloving young uncle and not with cruel melancholy me. and another nurse whom i never identified, and the village idiot who carted cots and coffins into the elevator, and the idiotic green love birds in a cage in the waiting roomall were in the plot, the sordid plot. i suppose mary thought comedy father professor humbertoldi was interfering with the romance between dolores and her fathersubstitute, rolypoly romeo for you          wererather lardy, you know, rom, despite all that snow and joy juice.         my throat hurt. i stood, swallowing, at the window and stared at the mountains, at the romantic rock high up in the smiling plotting sky.         my carmen, i said i used to call her that sometimes, we shall leave this raw sore town as soon as you get out of bed.         incidentally, i want all my clothes, said the gitanilla, humping up her knees and turning to another page.         because, really, i continued, there is no point in staying here.         there is no point in staying anywhere, said lolita.         i lowered myself into a cretonne chair and, opening the attractive botanical work, attempted, in the feverhumming hush of the room, to identify my flowers. this proved impossible. presently a musical bell softly sounded somewhere in the passage.         i do not think they had more than a dozen patients three or four were lunatics, as lo had cheerfully informed me earlier in that show place of a hospital, and the staff had too much leisure. howeverlikewise for reasons of showregulations were rigid. it is also true that i kept coming at the wrong hours. not without a secret flow of dreamy          malice, visionary mary next time it will be          une belle dame toute en bleufloating through roaring gulch plucked me by the sleeve to lead me out. i looked at her hand it dropped. as i was leaving, leaving voluntarily, dolores haze reminded me to bring her next morning she did not remember where the various things she wanted were bring me, she cried out of sight already, door on the move, closing, closed, the new gray suitcase and mothers trunk but by next morning i was shivering, and boozing, and dying nit he motel bed she had used for just a few minutes, and the best i could do under the circular and dilating circumstances was to send the two bags over with the widows beau, a robust and kindly trucker. i imagined lo displaying her treasures to mary no doubt, i was a little deliriousand on the following day i was still a vibration rather than a solid, for when i looked out the bathroom window at the adjacent lawn, i saw dollys beautiful young bicycle propped up there on its support, the graceful front wheel looking away from me, as it always did, and a sparrow perched on the saddlebut it was the landladys bike, and smiling a little, and shaking my poor head over my fond fancies, i tottered back to my bed, and lay as quiet as a saint                  saint, forsooth while brown dolores,         on a patch of sunny green         with sanchicha reading stories         in a movie magazine         which was represented by numerous specimens wherever dolores landed, and there was some great national celebration in town judging by the firecrackers, veritable bombs, that exploded all the time, and at five minutes to two p.m. i heard the sound of whistling lips nearing the halfopened door of my cabin, and then a thump upon it.         it was big frank. he remained framed in the opened door, one hand on its jamb, leaning forward a little.         howdy. nurse lore was on the telephone. she wanted to know was i better and would i come today         at twenty paces frank used to look a mountain of health at five, as now, he was a ruddy mosaic of scarshad been blown through a wall overseas but despite nameless injuries he was able to man a tremendous truck, fish, hunt, drink, and buoyantly dally with roadside ladies. that day, either because it was such a great holiday, or simply because he wanted to divert a sick man, he had taken off the glove he usually wore on his left hand the one pressing against the side of the door and revealed to the fascinated sufferer not only an entire lack of fourth and fifth fingers, but also a naked girl, with cinnabar nipples and indigo delta, charmingly tattooed on the back of his crippled hand, its index and middle digit making her legs while his wrist bore her flowercrowned head. oh, delicious reclining against the woodwork, like some sly fairy.         i asked him to tell mary lore i would stay in bed all day and would get into touch with my daughter sometime tomorrow if i felt probably polynesian.         he noticed the direction of my gaze and made her right hip twitch amorously.         okeydokey, big frank sang out, slapped the jamb, and whistling, carried my message away, and i went on drinking, and by morning the fever was gone, and although i was as limp as a toad, i put on the purple dressing gown over my maize yellow pajamas, and walked over to the office telephone. everything was fine. a bright voice informed me that yes, everything was fine, my daughter had checked out the day before, around two, her uncle, mr. gustave, had called for her with a cocker spaniel pup and a smile for everyone, and a black caddy lack, and had paid dollys bill in cash, and told them to tell me i should not worry, and keep warm, they were at grandpas ranch as agreed.         elphinstone was, and i hope still is, a very cute little town. it was spread like a maquette, you know, with its neat greenwool trees and redroofed houses over the valley floor and i think i have alluded earlier to its model school and temple and spacious rectangular blocks, some of which were, curiously enough, just unconventional pastures with a mule or a unicorn grazing in the young july morning mist. very amusing at one gravelgroaning sharp turn i sideswiped a parked car but said to myself telesticallyand, telepathically i hoped, to its gesticulating ownerthat i would return later, address bird school, bird, new bird, the gin kept my heart alive but bemazed my brain, and after some lapses and losses common to dream sequences, i found myself in the reception room, trying to beat up the doctor, and roaring at people under chairs, and clamoring for mary who luckily for her was not there rough hands plucked at my dressing gown, ripping off a pocket, and somehow i seem to have been sitting on a bald brownheaded patient, whom i had mistaken for dr. blue, and who eventually stood up, remarking with a preposterous accent now, who is nevrotic, i askand then a gaunt unsmiling nurse presented me with seven beautiful,          beautifulbooks and the exquisitely folded tartan lap robe, and demanded a receipt and in the sudden silence i became aware of a policeman in the hallway, to whom my fellow motorist was pointing me out, and meekly i signed the very symbolic receipt, thus surrendering my lolita to all those apes. but what else could i do one simple and stark thought stood out and this was freedom for the moment is everything. one false moveand i might have been made to explain a life of crime. so i simulated a coming out of a daze. to my fellow motorist i paid what he thought was fair. to dr. blue, who by then was stroking my hand, i spoke in tears of the liquor i bolstered too freely a tricky but not necessarily diseased heart with. to the hospital in general i apologized with a flourish that almost bowled me over, adding however that i was not on particularly good terms with the rest of the humbert clan. to myself i whispered that i still had my gun, and was still a free manfree to trace the fugitive, free to destroy my brother.                                             a thousandmile stretch of silksmooth road separated kasbeam, where, to the best of my belief, the red fiend had been scheduled to appear for the first time, and fateful elphinstone which we had reached about a week before independence day. the journey had taken up most of june for we had seldom made more than a hundred and fifty miles per traveling day, spending the rest of the time, up to five days in one case, at various stopping places, all of them also prearranged, no doubt. it was that stretch, then, along which the fiends spoor should be sought and to this i devoted myself, after several unmentionable days of dashing up and down the relentlessly radiating roads in the vicinity of elphinstone.         imagine me, reader , with my shyness, my distaste for any ostentation, my inherent sense of the          comme il faut, imagine me masking the frenzy of my grief with a trembling ingratiating smile while devising some casual pretext to flip through the hotel register oh, i would say, i am almost positive that i stayed here oncelet me look up the entries for midjuneno, i see im wrong after allwhat a very quaint name for a home town, kawtagain. thanks very much. or i had a customer staying herei mislaid his addressmay i and every once in a while, especially if the operator of the place happened to be a certain type of gloomy male, personal inspection of the books was denied me.         i have a memo here between july  and november , when i returned to beardsley for a few days, i registered, if not actually stayed, at  hotels, motels and tourist homes. this figure includes a few registrations between chestnut and beardsley, one of which yielded a shadow of the fiend n. petit, larousse, ill. i had to space and time my inquiries carefully so as not to attract undue attention and there must have been at least fifty places where i merely inquired at the deskbut that was a futile quest, and i preferred building up a foundation of verisimilitude and good will by first paying for an unneeded room. my survey showed that of the  or so books inspected, at least  provided me with a clue the loitering fiend had stopped even more often than we, or elsehe was quite capable of thathe had thrown in additional registrations in order to keep me well furnished with derisive hints. only in one case had he actually stayed at the same motor court as we, a few paces from lolitas pillow. in some instances he had taken up quarters in the same or in a neighboring block not infrequently he had lain in wait at an intermediate spot between two bespoken points. how vividly i recalled lolita, just before our departure from beardsley, prone on the parlor rug, studying tour books and maps, and marking laps and stops with her lipstick         i discovered at once that he had foreseen my investigations and had planted insulting pseudonyms for my special benefit. at the very first motel office i visited, ponderosa lodge, his entry, among a dozen obviously human ones, read dr. gratiano forbeson, mirandola, ny. its italian comedy connotations could not fail to strike me, of course. the landlady deigned to inform me that the gentleman had been laid up for five days with a bad cold, that he had left his car for repairs in some garage or other and that he had checked out on the th of july. yes, a girl called ann lore had worked formerly at the lodge, but was now married to a grocer in cedar city. one moonlit night i waylaid whiteshoed mary on a solitary street an automaton, she was about to shriek, but i managed to humanize her by the simple act of falling on my knees and with pious yelps imploring her to help. she did not know a thing, she swore. who was this gratiano forbeson she seemed to waver. i whipped out a hundreddollar bill. she lifted it to the light of the moon. he is your brother, she whispered at last. i plucked the bill out of her mooncold hand, and spitting out a french curse turned and ran away. this taught me to rely on myself alone. no detective could discover the clues trapp had tuned to my mind and manner. i could not hope, of course, he would ever leave his correct name and address but i did hope he might slip on the glaze of his own subtlety, by daring, say, to introduce a richer and more personal shot of color than strictly necessary, or by revealing too much through a qualitative sum of quantitative parts which revealed too little. in one thing he succeeded he succeeded in thoroughly enmeshing me and my thrashing anguish in his demoniacal game. with infinite skill, he swayed and staggered, and regained an impossible balance, always leaving me with the sportive hopeif i may use such a term in speaking of betrayal, fury, desolation, horror and hatethat he might give himself away next time. he never didthough coming damn close to it. we all admire the spangled acrobat with classical grace meticulously walking his tight rope in the taclum light but how much rarer art there is in the sagging rope expert wearing scarecrow clothes and impersonating a grotesque drunk          ishould know.         the clues he left did not establish his identity but they reflected his personality, or at least a certain homogenous and striking personality his genre, his type of humorat its best at leatthe tone of his brain, had affinities with my own. he mimed and mocked me. his allusions were definitely highbrow. he was wellread. he knew french. he was versed in logodaedaly and logomancy. he was an amateur of sex lore. he had a feminine handwriting. he would change his name but he could not disguise, no matter how he slanted them, his very peculiar ts, ws and ls. quelquepart island was one of his favorite residences. he did not use a fountain pen which fact, as any psychoanalyst will tell you, meant that the patient was a repressed undinist. one mercifully hopes there are water nymphs in the styx.         his main trait was his passion for tantalization. goodness, what a tease the poor fellow was he challenged my scholarship. i am sufficiently proud of my knowing something to be modest about my not knowing all and i daresay i missed some elements in that cryprogrammic paper chase. what a shiver of triumph and loathing shook my frail frame when, among the plain innocent names in the hotel recorder, his fiendish conundrum would ejaculate in my face i noticed that whenever he felt his enigmas were becoming too recondite, even for such a solver as i, he would lure me back with an easy one. arsne lupin was obvious to a frenchman who remembered the detective stories of his youth and one hardly had to be a coleridgian to appreciate the trite poke of a. person, porlock, england. in horrible taste but basically suggestive of a cultured mannot a policeman, not a common good, not a lewd salesmanwere such assumed names as arthur rainbowplainly the travestied author of          le bateau bleulet me laugh a little too, gentlemenand morris schmetterling, of          loiseau ivrefame           touch, reader. the silly but funny d. orgon, elmira, ny, was from molire, of course, and because i had quite recently tried to interest lolita in a famous thcentury play, i welcomed as an old friend harry bumper, sheridan, wyo. an ordinary encyclopedia informed me who the peculiar looking phineas quimby, lebanon, nh was and any good freudian, with a german name and some interest in religious prostitution, should recognize at a glance the implication of dr. kitzler, eryx, miss. so far so good. that sort of fun was shoddy but on the whole impersonal and thus innocuous. among entries that arrested my attention as undoubtable clues          per sebut baffled me in respect to their finer points i do not care to mention many since i feel i am groping in a borderland mist with verbal phantoms turning, perhaps, into living vacationists. who was johnny randall, ramble, ohio or was he a real person who just happened to write a hand similar to n.s. aristoff, catagela, ny what was the sting in catagela and what about james mavor morell, hoaxton, england aristophanes, hoaxfine, but what was i missing         there was one strain running through all that pseudonymity which caused me especially painful palpitations when i came across it. such things as g. trapp, geneva, ny. was the sign of treachery on lolitas part. aubrey beardsley, quelquepart island suggested more lucidly than the garbled telephone message had that the starting point of the affair should be looked for in the east. lucas picador, merrymay, pa. insinuated that my carmen had betrayed my pathetic endearments to the impostor. horribly cruel, forsooth, was will brown, dolores, colo. the gruesome harold haze, tombstone, arizona which at another time would have appealed to my sense of humor implied a familiarity with the girls past that in nightmare fashion suggested for a moment that my quarry was an old friend of the family, maybe an old flame of charlottes, maybe a redresser of wrongs donald quix, sierra, nev.. but the most penetrating bodkin was the anagramtailed entry in the register of chestnut lodge ted hunter, cane, nh.         the garbled license numbers left by all these persons and orgons and morells and trapps only told me that motel keepers omit to check if guests cars are accurately listed. referenesincompletely or incorrectly indicatedto the cars the fiend had hired for short laps between wace and elphinstone were of course useless the license of the initial aztec was a shimmer of shifting numerals, some transposed, others altered or omitted, but somehow forming interrelated combinations such as ws  and sh , and q or cu which however were so cunningly contrived as to never reveal a common denominator.         it occurred to me that after he had turned that convertible over to accomplices at wace and switched to the stagemotor car system, his successors might have been less careful and might have inscribed at some hotel office the archtype of those interrelated figures. but if looking for the fiend along a road i knew he had taken was such a complicated vague and unprofitable business, what could i expect from any attempt to trace unknown motorists traveling along unknown routes                                             by the time i reached beardsley, in the course of the harrowing recapitulation i have now discussed at sufficient length, a complete image had formed in my mind and through thealways riskyprocess of elimination i had reduced this image to the only concrete source that morbid cerebration and torpid memory could give it.         except for the rev. rigor mortis as the girls called him, and an old gentleman who taught nonobligatory german and latin, there were no regular male teachers t beardsley school. but on two occasions an art instructor on the beardsley college faculty had come over to show the schoolgirls magic lantern pictures of french castles and nineteenthcentury paintings. i had wanted to attend those projections and talks, but dolly, as was her wont, had asked me not to, period. i also remembered that gaston had referred to that particular lecturer as a brilliant          garon but that was all memory refused to supply me with the name of the chateaulover.         on the day fixed for the execution, i walked though the sleet across the campus to the information desk in maker hall, beardsley college. there i learned that the fellows name was riggs rather like that of the minister, that he was a bachelor, and that in ten minutes he would issue from the museum where he was having a class. in the passage leading to the auditorium i sat on a marble bench of sorts donated by cecilia dalrymple ramble. as i waited there, in the prostatic discomfort, drunk, sleepstarved, with my gun in my fist in my raincoat pocket, it suddenly occurred to me that i was demented and was about to do something stupid. there was not one chance in a million that albert riggs, ass. prof., was hiding my lolita at his beardsley home,  pritchard road. he could not be the villain. it was absolutely preposterous. i was losing my time and my wits. he and she were in california and not here at all.         presently, i noticed a vague commotion behind some white statues a doornot the one i had been staring atopened briskly, and amid a bevy of women students a baldish head and two bright brown eyes bobbed, advanced.         he was a total stranger to me but insisted we had met at a lawn party at beardsley school. how was my delightful tennisplaying daughter he had another class. he would be seeing me.         another attempt at identification was less speedily resolved through an advertisement in one of los magazines i dared to get in touch with a private detective, an expugilist, and merely to give him some idea of the          methodadopted by the fiend, i acquainted him with the kind of names and addresses i had collected. he demanded a goodish deposit and for two yearstwo years, readerthat imbecile busied himself with checking those nonsense data. i had long severed all monetary relations with him when he turned up one day with the triumphant information that an eightyyearold indian by the name of bill brown lived near dolores, colo.                                             this book is about lolita and now that i have reached the part which had i not been forestalled by another internal combustion martyr might be called           dolors disparue, there would be little sense in analyzing the three empty years that followed. while a few pertinent points have to be marked, the general impression i desire to convey is of a side door crashing open in lifes full flight, and a rush of roaring black time drowning with its whipping wind the cry of lone disaster.         singularly enough, i seldom if ever dreamed of lolita as i remembered heras i saw her constantly and obsessively in my conscious mind during my daymares and insomnias. more precisely she did haunt my sleep but she appeared there in strange and ludicrous disguises as valeria or charlotte, or a cross between them. that complex ghost would come to me, shedding shift after shift, in an atmosphere of great melancholy and disgust, and would recline in dull invitation on some narrow board or hard settee, with flesh ajar like the rubber valve of a soccer balls bladder. i would bind myself, dentures fractured or hopelessly mislaid, in horrible          chambres garnieswhere i would be entertained at tedious vivisecting parties that generally ended with charlotte or valeria weeping in my bleeding arms and being tenderly kissed by my brotherly lips in a dream disorder of auctioneered viennese bricbrac, pity, impotence and the brown wigs of tragic old women who had just been gassed.         one day i removed from the car and destroyed an accumulation of teenmagazines. you know the sort. stone age at heart up to date, or at least mycenaean, as to hygiene. a handsome, very ripe actress with huge lashes and a pulpy red underlip, endorsing a shampoo. ads and fads. young scholars dote on plenty of pleats          que ctait loin, tout celait is your hostess duty to provide robes. unattached details take all the sparkle out of your conversation. all of us have known pickersone who picks her cuticle at the office party. unless he is very elderly or very important, a man should remove his gloves before shaking hands with a woman. invite romance by wearing the exciting new tummy flattener. trims tums, nips hips. tristram in movielove. yessir the joeroe marital enigma is making yaps flap. glamorize yourself quickly and inexpensively. comics. bad girl dark hair fat father cigar good girl red hair handsome daddums clipped mustache. or that repulsive strip with the big gagoon and his wife, a kiddoid gnomide.          et         moi qui toffrais mon genie i recalled the rather charming nonsense verse i used to write her when she was a child nonsense, she used to say mockingly, is correct.         the squirl and his squirrel, the rabs and their rabbits         have certain obscure and peculiar habits.         male hummingbirds make the most exquisite rockets.         the snake when he walks holds his hands in his pockets         other things of hers were harder to relinquish. up to the end of , i cherished and adored, and stained with my kisses and merman tears, a pair of old sneakers, a boys shirt she had worn, some ancient blue jeans i found in the trunk compartment, a crumpled school cap, suchlike wanton treasures. then, when i understood my mind was cracking, i collected those sundry belongings, added to them what had been stored in beardsleya box of books, her bicycle, old coats, galoshesand on her fifteenth birthday mailed everything as an anonymous gift to a home for orphaned girls on a windy lake, on the canadian border.         it is just possible that had i gone to a strong hypnotist he might have extracted from me and arrayed in a logical pattern certain chance memories that i have threaded through my book with considerably more ostentation than they present themselves with to my mind even now when i know what to seek in the past. at the time i felt i was merely losing contact with reality and after spending the rest of the winter and most of the following spring in a quebec sanatorium where i had stayed before, i resolved first to settle some affairs of mine in new york and then to proceed to california for a thorough search there.         here is something i composed in my retreat                    wanted, wanted dolores haze.           hair brown. lips scarlet.           age five thousand three hundred days.           profession none, or starlet.           where are you hiding, dolores haze                      whyare you hiding, darling           i talk in a daze, i walk in a maze,           i cannot get out, said the starling.           where are you riding, dolores haze           what make is the magic carpet           is a cream cougar the present craze           and where are you parked, my car pet           who is your hero, dolores haze           still one of those bluecaped starmen           oh the balmy days and the palmy bays,           and the cars, and the bars, my carmen           oh dolores, that jukebox hurts           are you still dancin, darlin           both in worn levis, both in torn tshirts,           and i, in my corner, snarlin.           happy, happy is gnarled mcfate           touring the states with a child wife,           plowing his molly in every state           among the protected wild life.           my dolly, my folly her eyes were            vair,           and never closed when i kissed her.           know an old perfume called            soleil vert           are you from paris, mister                        lautre soir un air froid dopra malita                                   son ftbien fol est qui

hate and remorse, im dying.           and again my hairy fist i raise,           and again i hear you crying.           officer, officer, there they go           in the rain, where that lighted store is           and her socks are white, and i love her so,           and her name is haze, dolores.           officer, officer, there they are           dolores haze and her lover           whip out your gun and follow that car.           now tumble out, and take cover.           wanted, wanted dolores haze.           her dreamgray gaze never flinches.           ninety pounds is all she weighs           with a height of sixty inches.           my car is limping, dolores haze,           and the last long lap is the hardest,           and i shall be dumped where the weed decays,           and the rest is rust and stardust.                  by psychoanalyzing this poem, i notice it is really a maniacs masterpiece. the stark, stiff, lurid rhymes correspond very exactly to certain perspectiveless and terrible landscapes and figures, and magnified parts of landscapes and figures, as drawn by psychopaths in tests devised by their astute trainers. i wrote many more poems. i immersed myself in the poetry of others. but not for a second did i forget the load of revenge.         i would be a knave to say, and the reader a fool to believe, that the shock of losing lolita cured me of pederosis. my accursed nature could not change, no matter how my love for her did. on playgrounds and beaches, my sullen and stealthy eye, against my will, still sought out the flash of a nymphets limbs, the sly tokens of lolitas handmaids and rosegirls. but one essential vision in me had withered never did i dwell now on possibilities of bliss with a little maiden, specific or synthetic, in some outoftheway place never did my fancy sink its fangs into lolitas sisters, far far away, in the coves of evoked islands.          thatwas all over, for the time being at least. on the other hand, alas, two years of monstrous indulgence had left me with certain habits of lust i feared lest the void i lived in might drive me to plunge into the freedom of sudden insanity when confronted with a chance temptation in some lane between school and supper. solitude was corrupting me. i needed company and care. my heart was a hysterical unreliable organ. this is how rita enters the picture.                                             she was twice lolitas age and three quarters of mine a very slight, darkhaired, paleskinned adult, weighing a hundred and five pounds, with charmingly asymmetrical eyes, and angular, rapidly sketched profile, and a most appealing          ensellureto her supple backi think she had some spanish or babylonian blood. i picked her up one depraved may evening somewhere between montreal and new york, or more narrowly, between toylestown and blake, at a drakishly burning bar under the sign of the tigermoth, where she was amiably drunk she insisted we had gone to school together, and she placed her trembling little hand on my ape paw. my senses were very slightly stirred but i decided to give her a try i didand adopted her as a constant companion. she was so kind, was rita, such a good sport, that i daresay she would have given herself to any pathetic creature or fallacy, an old broken tree or a bereaved porcupine, out of sheer chumminess and compassion.         when i first met her she had but recently divorced her third husbandand a little more recently had been abandoned by her seventh          cavalier servantthe others, the mutables, were too numerous and mobile to tabulate. her brother wasand no doubt still isa prominent, pastyfaced, suspendersandpaintedtiewearing politician, mayor and booster of his ballplaying, biblereading, grainhandling home town. for the last eight years he had been paying his great little sister several hundred dollars per month under the stringent condition that she would never never enter great little grainball city. she told me, with wails of wonder, that for some goddamn reason every new boy friend of hers would first of all take her grainballward it was a fatal attraction and before she knew what was what, she would find herself sucked into the lunar orbit of the town, and would be following the floodlit drive that encircled itgoing round and round, as she phrased it, like a goddamn mulberry moth.         she had a natty little coup and in it we traveled to california so as to give my venerable vehicle a rest. her natural speed was ninety. dear rita we cruised together for two dim years, from summer  to summer , and she was the sweetest, simplest, gentles, dumbest rita imaginable. in comparison to her, valechak was a schlegel, and charlotte a hegel. there is no earthly reason why i should dally with her in the margin of this sinister memoir, but let me say hi, ritawherever you are, drunk or hangoverish, rita, hi that she was the most soothing, the most comprehending companion that i ever had, and certainly saved me from the madhouse. i told her i was trying to trace a girl and plug that girls bully. rita solemnly approved of the planand in the course of some investigation she undertook on her own without really knowing a thing, around san humbertino, got entangled with a pretty awful crook herself i had the devil of a time retrieving herused and bruised but still cocky. then one day she proposed playing russian roulette with my sacred automatic i said you couldnt, it was not a revolver, and we struggled for it, until at last it went off, touching off a very thin and very comical spurt of hot water from the hole it made in the wall of the cabin room i remember her shrieks of laughter.         the oddly prepubescent curve of her back, her ricey skin, her slow languorous columbine kisses kept me from mischief. it is not the artistic aptitudes that are secondary sexual characters as some shams and shamans have said it is the other way around sex is but the ancilla of art. one rather mysterious spree that had interesting repercussions i must notice. i had abandoned the search the fiend was either in tartary or burning away in my cerebellum the flames fanned by my fancy and grief but certainly not having dolores haze play champion tennis on the pacific coast. one afternoon, on our way back east, in a hideous hotel, the kind where they hold conventions and where labeled, fat, pink men stagger around, all first names and business and boozedear rita and i awoke to find a third in our room, a blond, almost albino, young fellow with white eyelashes and large transparent ears, whom neither rita nor i recalled having ever seen in our sad lives. sweating in thick dirty underwear, and with old army boots on, he lay snoring on the double bed beyond my chaste rita. one of his front teeth was gone, amber pustules grew on his forehead. ritochka enveloped her sinuous nudity in my raincoatthe first thing at hand i slipped on a pair of candystriped drawers and we took stock of the situation. five glasses had been used, which in the way of clues, was an embarrassment of riches. the door was not properly closed. a sweater and a pair of shapeless tan pants lay on the floor. we shook their owner into miserable consciousness. he was completely amnesic. in an accent that rita recognized as pure brooklynese, he peevishly insinuated that somehow we had purloined his worthless identity. we rushed him into his clothes and left him at the nearest hospital, realizing on the way that somehow or other after forgotten gyrations, we ewer in grainball. half a year later rita wrote the doctor for news. jack humbertson as he had been tastelessly dubbed was still isolated from his personal past. oh mnemosyne, sweetest and most mischievous of muses         i would not have mentioned this incident had it not started a chain of ideas that resulted in my publishing in the          cantrip reviewan essay on mimir and memory, in which i suggested among other things that seemed original and important to that splendid reviews benevolent readers, a theory of perceptual time based on the circulation of the blood and conceptually depending to fill up this nutshell on the minds being conscious not only of matter but also of its own self, thus crating a continuous spanning of two points the storable future and the stored past. in result of this ventureand in culmination of the impression made by my previous          travauxi was called from new york, where rita and i were living in a little flat with a view of gleaming children taking shower baths far below in a fountainous arbor of central park, to cantrip college, four hundred miles away, for one year. i lodged there, in special apartments for poets and philosophers, from september  to june , while rita whom i preferred not to display vegetatedsomewhat indecorously, i am afraidin a roadside inn where i visited her twice a week. then she vanishedmore humanly than her predecessor had done a month later i found her in the local jail. she was          trs digne, had had her appendix removed, and managed to convince me that the beautiful bluish furs she had been accused of stealing from a mrs. roland maccrum had really been a spontaneous, if somewhat alcoholic, gift from roland himself. i succeeded in getting her out without appealing to her touchy brother, and soon afterwards we drove back to central park west, by way of briceland, where we had stopped for a few hours the year before.         a curious urge to relive my stay there with lolita had got hold of me. i was entering a phase of existence where i had given up all hope of tracing her kidnapper and her. i now attempted to fall back on old settings in order to save what still could be saved in the way of          souvenir, souvenir que me veuxtuautumn was ringing in the air. to a post card requesting twin beds professor hamburg got a prompt expression of regret in reply. they were full up. they had one bathless basement room with four beds which they thought i would not want. their note paper was headed                  the enchanted hunters         near churches         no dogs                    all legal beverages                           i wondered if the last statement was true. all did they have for instance sidewalk grenadine i also wondered if a hunter, enchanted or otherwise, would not need a pointer more than a pew, and with a spasm of pain i recalled a scene worthy of a great artist          petite nymphe accroupiebut that silky cocker spaniel had perhaps been a baptized one. noi felt i could not endure the throes of revisiting that lobby. there was a much better possibility of retrievable time elsewhere in soft, richcolored, autumnal briceland. leaving rita in a bar, i made for the town library. a twittering spinster was only too glad to help me disinter midaugust  from the bound          briceland gazette, and presently, in a secluded nook under a naked light, i was turning the enormous and fragile pages of a coffinblack volume almost as big as lolita.         reader          bruderwhat a foolish hamburg that hamburg was since his supersensitive system was loath to face the actual scene, he thought he could at least enjoy a secret part of itwhich reminds one of the tenth or twentieth soldier in the raping queue who throws the girls black shawl over her white face so as not to see those impossible eyes while taking his military pleasure in the sad, sacked village. what          ilusted to get was the printed picture that had chanced to absorb my trespassing image while the          gazettesphotographer was concentrating on dr. braddock and his group. passionately i hoped to find preserved the portrait of the artist as a younger brute. an innocent camera catching me on my dark way to lolitas bedwhat a magnet for mnemosyne i cannot well explain the true nature of that urge of mine. it was allied, i suppose, to that swooning curiosity which impels one to examine with a magnifying glass bleak little figuresstill life practically, and everybody about to throw upat an early morning execution, and the patients expression impossible to make out in the print. anyway, i was literally gasping for breath, and one corner of the book of doom kept stabbing me in the stomach while i scanned and skimmed

vin tristesmile to a pocketsized wizened truculently tight old man saying this waswhat was the name again, sona former schoolmate of hers. he tried to retain her, and in the slight scuffle that followed i hurt my thumb against his hard head. in the silent painted part where i walked her and aired her a little, she sobbed and said i would soon, soon leave her as everybody had, and i sang her a wistful french ballad, and strung together some fugitive rhymes to amuse her                    the place was called            enchanted hunters.query           what indian dyes, diana, did thy

cry again, and i marched her to the car, and we drove on to new york, and soon she was reasonably happy again high up in the haze on the little terrace of our flat. i notice i have somehow mixed up two events, my visit with rita to briceland on our way to carntrip, and our passing through briceland again on our way back to new york, but such suffusions of swimming colors are not to be disdained by the artist in recollection.                                             my letterbox in the entrance hall belonged to the type that allows one to glimpse something of its contents through a glassed slit. several times already, a trick of harlequin light that fell through the glass upon an alien handwriting had twisted it into a semblance of lolitas script causing me almost to collapse as i leant against an adjacent urn, almost my own. whenever that happenedwhenever her lovely, childish scrawl was horribly transformed into the dull hand of one of my few correspondentsi used to recollect, with anguished amusement, the times in my trustful, predolorian past when i would be misled by a jewelbright window opposite wherein my lurking eye, the ever alert periscope of my shameful vice, would make out from afar a halfnaked nymphet stilled in the act of combing her aliceinwonderland hair. there was in the fiery phantasm a perfection which made my wild delight also perfect, just because the vision was out of reach, with no possibility of attainment to spoil it by the awareness of an appended taboo indeed, it may well be that the very attraction immaturity has for me lies not so much in the limpidity of pure young forbidden fairy child beauty as in the security of a situation where infinite perfections fill the gap between the little given and the great promisedthe great rosegray nevertobehad.          mes fentreshanging above blotched sunset and welling night, grinding my teeth, i would crowd all the demons of my desire against the railing of a throbbing balcony it would be ready to take off in the apricot and black humid evening did take offwhereupon the lighted image would move and even would revert to a rib, and there would be nothing in the window but an obese partly clad man reading the paper.         since i sometimes won the race between my fancy and natures reality, the deception was bearable. unbearable pain began when chance entered the fray and deprived me of the smile meant for me.           savezvous qu dix ans ma petite tait folle de voiussaid a woman i talked to at a tea in paris, and the          petitehad just married, miles away, and i could not even remember if i had ever noticed her in that garden, next to those tennis courts, a dozen years before. and now likewise, the radiant foreglimpse, the promise of reality, a promise not only to be simulated seductively but also to be nobly heldall this, chance denied mechance and a change to smaller characters on the pale beloved writers part. my fancy was both proustianized and procrusteanized for that particular morning, late in september , as i had come down to grope for my mail, the dapper and bilious janitor with whom i was on execrable terms started to complain that a man who had seen rita home recently had been sick like a dog on the front steps. in the process of listening to him and tipping him, and then listening to a revised and politer version of the incident, i had the impression that one of the two letters which that blessed mail brought was from ritas mother, a crazy little woman, whom we had once visited on cape cod and who kept writing me to my various addresses, saying how wonderfully well matched her daughter and i were, and how wonderful it would be if we married the other letter which i opened and scanned rapidly in the elevator was from john farlow.         i have often noticed that we are inclined to endow our friends with the stability of type that literary characters acquire in the readers mind. no matter how many times we reopen king lear, never shall we find the good king banging his tankard in high revelry, all woes forgotten, at a jolly reunion with all three daughters and their lapdogs. never will emma rally, revived by the sympathetic salts in flauberts fathers timely tear. whatever evolution this or that popular character has gone through between the book covers, his fate is fixed in our minds, and, similarly, we expect our friends to follow this or that logical and conventional pattern we have fixed for them. thus x will never compose the immortal music that would clash with the secondrate symphonies he has accustomed us to. y will never commit murder. under no circumstances can z ever betray us. we have it all arranged in our minds, and the less often we see a particular person the more satisfying it is to check how obediently he conforms to our notion of him every time we hear of him. any deviation in the fates we have ordained would strike us as not only anomalous but unethical. we would prefer not to have known at all our neighbor, the retired hotdog stand operator, if it turns out he has just produced the greatest book of poetry his age has seen.         i am saying all this in order to explain how bewildered i was by farlows hysterical letter. i knew his wife had died but i certainly expected him to remain, throughout a devout widowhood, the dull, sedate and reliable person he had always been. now he wrote that after a brief visit to the u.s. he had returned to south america and had decided that whatever affairs he had controlled at ramsdale he would hand over to jack windmuller of that town, a lawyer whom we both knew. he seemed particularly relieved to get rid of the haze complications. he had married a spanish girl. he had stopped smoking and had gained thirty pounds. she was very young and a ski champion. they were going to india for their honeymonsoon. since he was building a family as he put it, he would have no time henceforth for my affairs which he termed very strange and very aggravating. busybodiesa whole committee of them, it appearedhad informed him that the whereabouts of little dolly haze were unknown, and that i was living with a notorious divorcee in california. his fatherinlaw was a count, and exceedingly wealthy. the people who had been renting the haze house for some years now wished to buy it. he suggested that i better produce dolly quick. he had broken his leg. he enclosed a snapshot of himself and a brunette in white wool beaming at each other among the snows of chile.         i remember letting myself into my flat and starting to say well, at least we shall now track them downwhen the other letter began talking to me in a small matteroffact voice                             dear dad           hows everything im married. im going to have a baby. i guess hes going to be a big one. i guess hell come right for christmas. this is a hard letter to write. im going nuts because we dont have enough to pay our debts and get out of here. dick is promised a big job in alaska in his very specialized corner of the mechanical field, thats all i know about it but its really grand. pardon me for withholding our home address but you may still be mad at me, and dick must not know. this town is something. you cant see the morons for the smog. please do send us a check, dad. we could manage with three or four hundred or even less, anything is welcome, you might sell my old things, because once we go there the dough will just start rolling in. writ, please. i have gone through much sadness and hardship.           yours expecting,           dolly mrs. richard f. schiller                                                      i was again on the road, again at the wheel of the old blue sedan, again alone. rita had still been dead to the world when i read that letter and fought the mountains of agony it raised within me. i had glanced at her as she smiled in her sleep and had kissed her on her moist brow, and had left her forever, with a note of tender adieu which i taped to her navelotherwise she might not have found it.         alone did i say          pas tout fait.i had my little black chum with me, and as soon as i reached a secluded spot, i rehearsed mr. richard f. schillers violent death. i had found a very old and very dirty gray sweater of mine in the back of the car, and this i hung up on a branch, in a speechless glade, which i had reached by a wood road from the now remote highway. the carrying out of the sentence was a little marred by what seemed to me a certain stiffness in the play of the trigger, and i wondered if i should get some oil for the mysterious thing but decided i had no time to spare. back into the car went the old dead sweater, now with additional perforations, and having reloaded warm chum, i continued my journey.         the letter was dated september ,  this was september , and the address she gave was general delivery, coalmont not va., not pa., not tenn.and not coalmont, anywayi have camouflaged everything, my love. inquiries showed this to be a small industrial community some eight hundred miles from new york city. at first i planned to drive all day and all night, but then thought better of it and rested for a couple of hours around dawn in a motor court room, a few miles before reaching the town. i had made up my mind that the fiend, this schiller, had been a car salesman who had perhaps got to know my lolita by giving her a ride in beardsleythe day her bike blew a tire on the way to miss emperorand that he had got into some trouble since then. the corpse of the executed sweater, no matter how i changed its contours as it lay on the back seat of the car, had kept revealing various outlines pertaining to trappschillerthe grossness and obscene bonhomie of his body, and to counteract this taste of coarse corruption i resolved to make myself especially handsome and smart as i pressed home the nipple of my alarm clock before it exploded at the set hour of six a.m. then, with the stern and romantic care of a gentleman about to fight a duel, i checked the arrangement of my papers, bathed and perfumed my delicate body, shaved my face and chest, selected a silk shirt and clean drawers, pulled on transparent taupe socks, and congratulated myself for having with me in my trunk some very exquisite clothesa waistcoat with nacreous buttons, for instance, a pale cashmere tie and so on.         i was not able, alas, to hold my breakfast, but dismissed that physicality as a trivial contretemps, wiped my mouth with a gossamer handkerchief produced from my sleeve, and, with a blue block of ice for heart, a pill on my tongue and solid death in my hip pocket, i stepped neatly into a telephone booth in coalmont ahahah, said its little door and rang up the only schillerpaul, furnitureto be found in the battered book. hoarse paul told me he did know a richard, the son of a cousin of his, and his address was, let me see,  killer street i am not going very far for my pseudonyms. ahahah, said the little door.         at  killer street, a tenement house, i interviewed a number of dejected old people and two longhaired strawberryblond incredibly grubby nymphets rather abstractly, just for the heck of it, the ancient beast in me was casting about for some lightly clad child i might hold against me for a minute, after the killing was over and nothing mattered any more, and everything was allowed. yes, dick skiller had lived there, but had moved when he married. nobody knew his address. they might know at the store, said a bass voice from an open manhole near which i happened to be standing with the two thinarmed, barefoot little girls and their dim grandmothers. i entered the wrong store and a wary old negro shook his head even before i could ask anything. i crossed over to a bleak grocery and there, summoned by a customer at my request, a womans voice from some wooden abyss in the floor, the manholes counterpart, cried out hunter road, last house.         hunter road was miles away, in an even more dismal district, all dump and ditch, and wormy vegetable garden, and shack, and gray drizzle, and red mud, and several smoking stacks in the distance. i stopped at the last housea clapboard shack, with two or three similar ones farther away from the road and a waste of withered weeds all around. sounds of hammering came from behind the house, and for several minutes i sat quite still in my old car, old and frail, at the end of my journey, at my gray goal,          finis, my friends,          finis,my friends. the time was around two. my pulse was  one minute and  the next. the drizzle crepitated against the hood of the car. my gun had migrated to my right trouser pocket. a nondescript cur came out from behind the house, stopped in surprise, and started goodnaturedly woofwoofing at me, his eyes slit, his shaggy belly all muddy, and then walked about a little and woofed once more.                                             i got out of the car and slammed its door. how matteroffact, how square that slam sounded in the void of the sunless day          woof, commented the dog perfunctorily. i pressed the bell button, it vibrated through my whole system.          personne.         je resonne.         repersonne.from what depth this renonsense woof, said the dog. a rush and a shuffle, and wooshwoof went the door.         couple of inches taller. pinkrimmed glasses. new, heapedup hairdo, new ears. how simple the moment, the death i had kept conjuring up for three years was as simple as a bit of dry wood. she was frankly and hugely pregnant. her head looked smaller only two seconds had passed really, but let me give them as much wooden duration as life can stand, and her palefreckled cheeks were hollowed, and her bare shins and arms had lost all their tan, so that the little hairs showed. she wore a brown, sleeveless cotton dress and sloppy felt slippers.         weeell she exhaled after a pause with all the emphasis of wonder and welcome.         husband at home i croaked, fist in pocket.         i could not kill          her,of course, as some have thought. you see, i loved her. it was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight.         come in, she said with a vehement cheerful note. against the splintery deadwood of the door, dolly schiller flattened herself as best she could even rising on tiptoe a little to let me pass, and was crucified for a moment, looking down, smiling down at the threshold, hollowcheeked with round          pommettes,her wateredmilkwhite arms outspread on the wood. i passed without touching her bulging babe. dollysmell, with a faint fried addition. my teeth chattered like an idiots. no, you stay out to the dog. she closed the door and followed me and her belly into the dollhouse parlor.         dicks down there, she said pointing with an invisible tennis racket, inviting my gaze to travel from the drab parlorbedroom where we stood, right across the kitchen, and through the back doorway where, in a rather primitive vista, a darkhaired young stranger in overalls, instantaneously reprieved, was perched with his back to me on a ladder fixing something near or upon the shack of his neighbor, a plumper fellow with only one arm, who stood looking up.         this pattern she explained from afar, apologetically men will be men should she call him in         no.         standing in the middle of the slanting room and emitting questioning hms, she made familiar javanese gestures with her wrists and hands, offering me, in a brief display of humorous courtesy, to choose between a rocker and the divan their bed after ten p.m.. i say familiar because one day she had welcomed me with the same wrist dance to her party in beardsley. we both sat down on the divan. curious although actually her looks had faded, i definitely realized, so hopelessly late in the day, how much she lookedhad always lookedlike botticellis russet venusthe same soft nose, the same blurred beauty. in my pocket my fingers gently let go and repacked a little at the tip, within the handkerchief it was nested in, my unused weapon.         thats not the fellow i want, i said.         the diffuse look of welcome left her eyes. her forehead puckered as in the old bitter days         not          who         where is he quick         look, she said, inclining her head to one side and shaking it in that position. look, you are not going to bring that up.         i certainly am, i said, and for a momentstrangely enough the only merciful, endurable one in the whole interviewwe were bristling at each other as if she were still mine.         a wise girl, she controlled herself.         dick did not know a thing of the whole mess. he thought i was her father. he thought she had run away from an upperclass home just to wash dishes in a diner. he believed anything. why should i want to make things harder than they were by raking up all that muck         but, i said, she must be sensible, she must be a sensible girl with her bare drum under that thin brown stuff, she must understand that if she expected the help i had come to give, i must have at least a clear comprehension of the situation.         come, his name         she thought i had guessed long ago. it was with a mischievous and melancholy smile such a sensational name. i would never believe it. she could hardly believe it herself.         his name, my fall nymph.         it was so unimportant, she said. she suggested i skip it. would i like a cigarette         no. his name.         she shook her head with great resolution. she guessed it was too late to raise hell and i would never believe the unbelievably unbelievable         i said i had better go, regards, nice to have seen her.         she said really it was useless, she would never tell, but on the other hand, after alldo you really want to know who it was well, it was         and softly, confidentially, arching her thin eyebrows and puckering her parched lips, she emitted, a little mockingly, somewhat fastidiously, not untenderly, in a kind of muted whistle, the name that the astute reader has guessed long ago.         waterproof. why did a flash from hourglass lake cross my consciousness i, too, had known it, without knowing it, all along. there was no shock, no surprise. quietly the fusion took place, and everything fell into order, into the pattern of branches that i have woven throughout this memoir with the express purpose of having the ripe fruit fall at the right moment yes, with the express and perverse purpose of renderingshe was talking but i sat melting in my golden peaceof rendering that golden and monstrous peace through the satisfaction of logical recognition, which my most inimical reader should experience now.         she was, as i say, talking. it now came in a relaxed flow. he was the only man she had ever been crazy about. what about dick oh, dick was a lamb, they were quite happy together, but she meant something different. and          ihad never counted, of course         she considered me as if grasping all at once the incredibleand somehow tedious, confusing and unnecessaryfact that the distant, elegant, slender, fortyyearold valetudinarian in velvet coat sitting beside her had known and adored every pore and follicle of her pubescent body. in her washedout gray eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party, like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.         i just managed to jerk my knee out of the range of a sketchy tapone of her acquired gestures.         she asked me not to be dense. the past was the past. i had been a good father, she guessedgranting me          that.proceed, dolly schiller.         well, did i know that he had known her mother that he was practically an old friend that he had visited with his uncle in ramsdaleoh, years agoand spoken at mothers club, and had tugged and pulled her, dolly, by her bare arm onto his lap in front of everybody, and kissed her face, she was ten and furious with him did i know he had seen me and her at the inn where he was writing the very play she was to rehearse in beardsley, two years later did i knowit had been horrid of her to sidetrack me into believing that clare was an old female, maybe a relative of his or a sometime lifemateand oh, what a close shave it had been when the wace          journalcarried his picture.         the          briceland gazettehad not. yes, very amusing.         yes, she said, this world was just one gag after another, if somebody wrote up her life nobody would ever believe it.         at this point, there came brisk homey sounds from the kitchen into which dick and bill had lumbered in quest of beer. through the doorway they noticed the visitor, and dick entered the parlor.         dick, this is my dad cried dolly in a resounding violent voice that struck me as a totally strange, and new, and cheerful, and old, and sad, because the young fellow, veteran of a remote war, was hard of hearing.         arctic blue eyes, black hair, ruddy cheeks, unshaven chin. we shook hands. discreet bill, who evidently took pride in working wonders with one hand, brought in the beer cans he had opened. wanted to withdraw. the exquisite courtesy of simple folks. was made to stay. a beer ad. in point of fact, i preferred it that way, and so did the schillers. i switched to the jittery rocker. avidly munching, dilly plied me with marshmallows and potato chips. the men looked at her fragile,          frileux, diminutive, oldworld, youngish but sickly, father in velvet coat and beige vest, maybe a viscount.         they were under the impression i had come to stay, and dick with a great wrinkling of brows that denoted difficult thought, suggested dolly and he might sleep in the kitchen on a spare mattress. i waved a light hand and told dolly who transmitted it by means of a special shout to dick that i had merely dropped in on my way to readsburg where i was to be entertained by some friends and admirers. it was then noticed that one of the few thumbs remaining to bill was bleeding not such a wonderworker after all. how womanish and somehow never seen that way before was the shadowy division between her pale breasts when she bent down over the mans hand she took him for repairs to the kitchen. for a few minutes, three or four little eternities which positively welled with artificial warmth, dick and i remained alone. he sat on a hard chair rubbing his forelimbs and frowning. i had an idle urge to squeeze out the blackheads on the wings of his perspiring nose with my long agate claws. he had nice sad eyes with beautiful lashes, and very white teeth. his adams apple was large and hairy. why dont they shave better, those young brawny chaps he and his dolly had had unrestrained intercourse on that couch there, at least a hundred and eighty times, probably much more and before thathow long had she known him no grudge. funnyno grudge at all, nothing except grief and nausea. he was now rubbing his nose. i was sure that when finally he would open his mouth, he would say slightly shaking his head aw, shes a swell kid, mr. haze. she sure is. and shes going to make a swell mother. he opened his mouthand took a sip of beer. this gave him countenanceand he went on sipping till he frothed at the mouth. he was a lamb. he had cupped her florentine breasts. his fingernails were black and broken, but the phalanges, the whole carpus, the strong shapely wrist were far, far finer than mine i have hurt too much too many bodies with my twisted poor hands to be proud of them. french epithets, a dorset yokels knuckles, an austrian tailors flat finger tipsthats humbert humbert.         good. if he was silent i could be silent too. indeed, i could very well do with a little rest in this subdued, frightenedtodeath rocking chair, before i drove to wherever the beasts lair wasand then pulled the pistols foreskin back, and then enjoyed the orgasm of the crushed trigger i was always a good little follower of the viennese medicine man. but presently i became sorry for poor dick whom, in some hypnotoid way, i was horribly preventing from making the only remark he could think up shes a swell kid.         and so, i said, you are going to canada         in the kitchen, dolly was laughing at something bill had said or done.         and so, i shouted, you are going to canada not canadai reshoutedi mean alaska, of course.         he nursed his glass and, nodding sagely, replied well, he cut it on a jagger, i guess. lost his right arm in italy.         lovely mauve almond trees in bloom. a blownoff surrealistic arm hanging up there in the pointillistic mauve. a flowergirl tattoo on the hand. dolly and bandaided bill reappeared. it occurred to me that her ambiguous, brown and pale beauty excited the cripple. dick, with a grin of relief stood up. he guessed bill and he would be going back to fix those wires. he guessed mr. haze and dolly had loads of things to say to each other. he guessed he would be seeing me before i left. why do those people guess so much and shave so little, and are so disdainful of hearing aids         sit down, she said, audibly striking her flanks with her palms. i relapsed into the black rocker.         so you betrayed me where did you go where is he now         she took from the mantelpiece a concave glossy snapshot. old woman in white, stout, beaming, bowlegged, very short dress old man in his shirtsleeves, drooping mustache, watch chain. her inlaws. living with dicks brothers family in juneau.         sure you dont want to smoke         she was smoking herself. first time i saw her doing it.          streng verbotenunder humbert the terrible. gracefully, in a blue mist, charlotte haze rose from her grave. i would find him through uncle ivory if she refused.         betrayed you no. she directed the dart of her cigarette, index rapidly tapping upon it, toward the hearth exactly as her mother used to do, and then, like her mother, oh my god, with her fingernail scratched and removed a fragment of cigarette paper from her underlip. no. she had not betrayed me. i was among friends. edusa had warned her that cue liked little girls, had been almost jailed once, in fact nice fact, and he knew she knew. yes elbow in palm, puff, smile, exhaled smoke, darting gesture. waxing reminiscent. he sawsmilingthrough everything and everybody, because he was not like me and her but a genius. a great guy. full of fun. had rocked with laughter when she confessed about me and her, and said he had thought so. it was quite safe, under the circumstances, to tell him         well, cuethey all called him cue         her camp five years ago. curious coincidence took her to a dude ranch about a days drive from elephant elphinstone. named oh, some silly nameduk duk ranch          youknow just plain sillybut it did not matter now, anyway, because the place had vanished and disintegrated. really, she meant, i could not imagine how utterly lush that ranch was, she meant it had everything but everything, even an indoor waterfall. did i remember the redhaired guy we we was good had once had some tennis with well, the place really belonged to reds brother, but he had turned it over to cue for the summer. when cue and she came, the others had them actually go through a coronation ceremony and thena terrific ducking, as when you cross the equator.          youknow.         her eyes rolled in synthetic resignation.         go on, please.         well. the idea was he would take her in september to hollywood and arrange a tryout for her, a bit part in the tennismatch scene of a movie picture based on a play of his          golden gutsand perhaps even have her double one of its sensational starlets on the kliegstruck tennis court. alas, it never came to that.         where is the hog now         he was not a hog. he was a great guy in many respects. but it was all drink and drugs. and, of course, he was a complete freak in sex matters, and his friends were his slaves. i just could not imagine i, humbert, could not imagine what they all did at duk duk ranch. she refused to take part because she loved him, and he threw her out.         what things         oh, weird, filthy, fancy things. i mean, he had two girls and tow boys, and three or four men, and the idea was for all of us to tangle in the nude while an old woman took movie pictures. sades justine was twelve at the start.         what things exactly         oh, things oh, ireally ishe uttered the i as a subdued cry while she listened to the source of the ache, and for lack of words spread the five fingers of her angularly upanddownmoving hand. no, she gave it up, she refused to go into particulars with that baby inside her.         that made sense.         it is of no importance now, she said pounding a gray cushing with her fist and then lying back, belly up, on the divan. crazy things, filthy things. i said no, im just not going to she used, in all insouciance really, a disgusting slang term which, in a literal french translation, would be          souffler your beastly boys, because i want only you. well, he kicked me out.         there was not much else to tell. that winter , fay and she had found jobs. for almost two years she hadoh, just drifted, oh, doing some restaurant work in small places, and then she had met dick. no, she did not know where the other was. in new york, she guessed. of course, he was so famous she would have found him at once if she had wanted. fay had tried to get back to the ranchand it just was not there any moreit had burned to the ground,          nothingremained, just a charred heap of rubbish. it was so          strange,so          strange         she closed her eyes and opened her mouth, leaning back on the cushion, one felted foot on the floor. the wooden floor slanted, a little steel ball would have rolled into the kitchen. i knew all i wanted to know. i had no intention of torturing my darling. somewhere beyond bills shack an afterwork radio had begun singing of folly and fate, and there she was with her ruined looks and her adult, ropeveined narrow hands and her gooseflesh white arms, and her shallow ears, and her unkempt armpits, there she was my lolita, hopelessly worn at seventeen, with that baby, dreaming already in her of becoming a big shot and retiring around  a.d.and i looked and looked at her, and knew as clearly as i know i am to die, that i loved her more than anything i had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else. she was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the nymphet i had rolled myself upon with such cries in the past an echo on the brink of a russet ravine, with a far wood under a white sky, and brown leaves choking the brook, and one last cricket in the crisp weeds but thank god it was not that echo alone that i worshipped. what i used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart,          mon         grand pch radieux, had dwindled to its essence sterile and selfish vice, all          thati canceled and cursed. you may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court, but until i am gagged and halfthrottled, i will shout my poor truth. i insist the world know how much i loved my lolita,          thislolita, pale and polluted, and big with anothers child, but still grayeyed, still sootylashed, still auburn and almond, still carmencita, still mine          changeons de vie, ma carmen, allons vivre quelque part o nous ne serons jamais spars ohio the wilds of massachusetts no matter, even if those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish, and her nipples swell and crack, and her lovely young velvety delicate delta be tainted and torneven then i would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face, at the mere sound of your raucous young voice, my lolita.         lolita, i said, this may be neither here nor there but i have to say it. life is very short. from here to that old car you know so well thee is a stretch of twenty, twentyfive paces. it is a very short walk. make those twentyfive steps. now. right now. come just as you are. and we shall live happily ever after.                    carmen, voulezvous venir avec moi                  you mean, she said opening her eyes and raising herself slightly, the snake that may strike, you mean you will give us us that money only if i go with you to a motel. is          thatwhat you mean         no, i said, you got it all wrong. i want you to leave your incidental dick, and this awful hole, and come to live with me, and die with me, and everything with me words to that effect.         youre crazy, she said, her features working.         think it over, lolita. there are no strings attached. except, perhapswell, no matter. a reprieve, i wanted to say but did not. anyway, if you refuse you will still get your          trousseau.         no kidding asked dolly.         i handed her an envelope with four hundred dollars in cash and a check for three thousand six hundred more.         gingerly, uncertainly, she received          mon         petit cadeau and then her forehead became a beautiful pink. you mean, she said, with agonized emphasis, you are giving us          four thousand bucksi covered my face with my hand and broke into the hottest tears i had ever shed. i felt them winding through my fingers and down my chin, and burning me, and my nose got clogged, and i could not stop, and then she touched my wrist.         ill die if you touch me, i said. you are sure you are not coming with me is there no hope of your coming tell me only this.         no, she said. no, honey, no.         she had never called me honey before.         no, she said, it is quite out of the question. i would sooner go back to cue. i mean         she groped for words. i supplied them mentally           hebroke my heart.          youmerely broke my life.         i think, she went onoopsthe envelope skidded to the floorshe picked it upi think its oh utterly          grandof you to give us all that dough. it settles everything, we can start next week. stop crying, please. you should understand. let me get you some more beer. oh, dont cry, im so sorry i cheated so much, but thats the way things are.         i wiped my face and my fingers. she smiled at the          cadeau.she exulted. she wanted to call dick. i said i would have to leave in a moment, did not want to see him at all, at all. we tried to think of some subject of conversation. for some reason, i kept seeingit trembled and silkily glowed on my damn retinaa radiant child of twelve, sitting on a threshold, pinging pebbles at an empty can. i almost saidtrying to find some casual remarki wonder sometimes what has become of the little mccoo girl, did she ever get betterbut stopped in time lest she rejoin i wonder sometimes what has become of the little haze girl finally, i reverted to money matters. that sum, i said, represented more or less the net rent from her mothers house she said had it not been sold years ago no i admit i          hadtold her this in order to sever all connections with r. a lawyer would send a full account of the financial situation later it was rosy some of the small securities her mother had owned had gone up and up. yes, i was quite sure i had to go. i had to go, and find him, and destroy him.         since i would not have survived the touch of her lips, i kept retreating in a mincing dance, at every step she and her belly made toward me.         she and the dog saw me off. i was surprised this a rhetorical figure, i was not that the sight of the old car in which she had ridden as a child and a nymphet, left her so very indifferent. all she remarked was it was getting sort of purplish about the gills. i said it was hers, i could go by bus. she said dont be silly, they would fly to jupiter and buy a car there. i said i would buy this one from her for five hundred dollars.         at this rate well be millionnaires next, she said to the ecstatic dog.                  carmencita, lui demandaisjeone last word, i said in my horrible careful english, are you quite, quite sure thatwell, not tomorrow, of course, and not after tomorrow, butwellsome day, any day, you will not come to live with me i will create a brand new god and thank him with piercing cries, if you give me that microscopic hope to that effect.         no, she said smiling, no.         it would have made all the difference, said humbert humbert.         then i pulled out my automatici mean, this is the kind of fool thing a reader might suppose i did. it never even occurred to me to do it.         good byaye she changed, my american sweet immortal dead love for she is dead and immortal if you are reading this. i mean, such is the formal agreement with the socalled authorities.         then, as i drove away, i heard her shout in a vibrant voice to her dick and the dog started to lope alongside my car like a fat dolphin, but he was too heavy and old, and very soon gave up.         and presently i was driving through the drizzle of the dying day, with the windshield wipers in full action but unable to cope with my tears.                                             leaving as i did coalmont around four in the afternoon by route xi do not remember the number, i might have made ramsdale by dawn had not a shortcut tempted me. i had to get onto highway y. my map showed quite blandly that just beyond woodbine, which i reached at nightfall, i could leave paved x and reached paved y by means of a transverse dirt road. it was only some forty miles long according to my map. otherwise i would have to follow x for another hundred miles and then use leisurely looping z to get to y and my destination. however, the shortcut in question got worse and worse, bumpier and bumpier, muddier and muddier, and when i attempted to turn back after some ten miles of purblind, tortuous and tortoiseslow progress, my old and weak melmoth got stuck in deep clay. all was dark and muggy, and hopeless. my headlights hung over a broad ditch full of water. the surrounding country, if any, was a black wilderness. i sought to extricate myself but my rear wheels only whined in slosh and anguish. cursing my plight, i took off my fancy clothes, changed into slacks, pulled on the bulletriddled sweater, and waded four miles back to a roadside farm. it started to rain on the way but i had not the strength to go back for a mackintosh. such incidents have convinced me that my heart is basically sound despite recent diagnoses. around midnight, a wrecker dragged my car out. i navigated back to highway x and traveled on. utter weariness overtook me and hour later, in an anonymous little town. i pulled up at the curb and in darkness drank deep from a friendly flask.         the rain had been canceled miles before. it was a black warm night, somewhere in appalachia. now and then cars passed me, red taillights receding, white headlights advancing, but the town was dead. nobody strolled and laughed on the sidewalks as relaxing burghers would in sweet, mellow, rotting europe. i was alone to enjoy the innocent night and my terrible thoughts. a wire receptacle on the curb was very particular about acceptable contents sweepings. paper. no garbage. sherryred letters of light marked a camera shop. a large thermometer with the name of a laxative quietly dwelt on the front of a drugstore. rubinovs jewelry company had a display of artificial diamonds reflected in a red mirror. a lighted green clock swam in the linenish depths of jiffy jeff laundry. on the other side of the street a garage said in its sleepgenuflection lubricity and corrected itself to gulflex lubrication. an airplane, also gemmed by rubinov, passed, droning, in the velvet heavens. how many small deadofnight towns i had seen this was not yet the last.         let me dally a little, he is as good as destroyed. some way further across the street, neon lights flickered twice slower than my heart the outline of a restaurant sign, a large coffeepot, kept bursting, every full second or so, into emerald life, and every time it went out, pink letters saying fine foods relayed it, but the pot could still be made out as a latent shadow teasing the eye before its next emerald resurrection. we made shadowgraphs. this furtive burg was not far from the enchanted hunters. i was weeping again, drunk on the impossible past.                                             at this solitary stop for refreshments between coalmont and ramsdale between innocent dolly schiller and jovial uncle ivor, i reviewed my case. with the utmost simplicity and clarity i now saw myself and my love. previous attempts seemed out of focus in comparison. a couple of years before, under the guidance of an intelligent frenchspeaking confessor, to whom, in a moment of metaphysical curiosity, i had turned over a protestants drab atheism for an oldfashioned popish cure, i had hoped to deduce from my sense of sin the existence of a supreme being. on those frosty mornings in rimelaced quebec, the good priest worked on me with the finest tenderness and understanding. i am infinitely obliged to him and the great institution he represented. alas, i was unable to transcend the simple human fact that whatever spiritual solace i might find, whatever lithophanic eternities might be provided for me, nothing could make my lolita forget the foul lust i had inflicted upon her. unless it can be proven to meto me as i am now, today, with my heart and by beard, and my putrefactionthat in the infinite run it does not matter a jot that a north american girlchild named dolores haze had been deprived of her childhood by a maniac, unless this can be proven and if it can, then life is a joke, i see nothing for the treatment of my misery but the melancholy and very local palliative of articulate art. to quote an old poet                    the moral sense in mortals is the duty           we have to pay on mortal sense of beauty.                                                      there was the day, during our first tripour first circle of paradisewhen in order to enjoy my phantasms in peace i firmly decided to ignore what i could not help perceiving, the fact that i was to her not a boy friend, not a glamour man, not a pal, not even a person at all, but just two eyes and a foot of engorged brawnto mention only mentionable matters. there was the day when having withdrawn the functional promise i had made her on the eve whatever she had set her funny little heart ona roller rink with some special plastic floor or a movie matinee to which she wanted to go alone, i happened to glimpse from the bathroom, through a chance combination of mirror aslant and door ajar, a look on her face that look i cannot exactly describe an expression of helplessness so perfect that it seemed to grade into one of rather comfortable inanity just because this was the very limit of injustice and frustrationand every limit presupposes something beyond ithence the neutral illumination. and when you bear in mind that these were the raised eyebrows and parted lips of a child, you may better appreciate what depths of calculated carnality, what reflected despair, restrained me from falling at her dear feet and dissolving in human tears, and sacrificing my jealousy to whatever pleasure lolita might hope to derive from mixing with dirty and dangerous children in an outside world that was real to her.         and i have still other smothered memories, now unfolding themselves into limbless monsters of pain. once, in a sunsetending street of beardsley, she turned to little eva rosen i was taking both nymphets to a concert and walking behind them so close as almost to touch them with my person, she turned to eva, and so very serenely and seriously, in answer to something the other had said about its being better to die than hear milton pinski, some local schoolboy she knew, talk about music, my lolita remarked         you know, whats so dreadful about dying is that you are completely on your own and it struck me, as my automaton knees went up and down, that i simply did not know a thing about my darlings mind and that quite possibly, behind the awful juvenile clichs, there was in her a garden and a twilight, and a palace gatedim and adorable regions which happened to be lucidly and absolutely forbidden to me, in my polluted rags and miserable convulsions for i often noticed that living as we did, she and i, in a world of total evil, we would become strangely embarrassed whenever i tried to discuss something she and an older friend, she and a parent, she and a real healthy sweetheart, i and annabel, lolita and a sublime, purified, analyzed, deified harold haze, might have discussedan abstract idea, a painting, stippled hopkins or shorn baudelaire, god or shakespeare, anything of genuine kind. good will she would mail her vulnerability in trite brashness and boredom, whereas i, using for my desperately detached comments an artificial tone of voice that set my own last teeth on edge, provoked my audience to such outbursts of rudeness as made any further conversation impossible, oh my poor, bruised child.         i loved you. i was a pentapod monster, but i loved you. i was despicable and brutal, and turpid, and everything,          mais je taimais, je taimaisand there were times when i knew how you felt, and it was hell to know it, my little one. lolita girl, brave dolly schiller.         i recall certain moments, let us call them icebergs in paradise, when after having had my fill of herafter fabulous, insane exertions that left me limp and azurebarredi would gather her in my arms with, at last, a mute moan of human tenderness her skin glistening in the neon light coming from the paved court through the slits in the blind, her sootblack lashes matted, her grave gray eyes more vacant than everfor all the world a little patient still in the confusion of a drug after a major operationand the tenderness would deepen to shame and despair, and i would lull and rock my lone light lolita in my marble arms, and moan in her warm hair, and caress her at random and mutely ask her blessing, and at the peak of this human agonized selfless tenderness with my soul actually hanging around her naked body and ready to repent, all at once, ironically, horribly, lust would swell againand oh,          no, lolita would say with a sigh to heaven, and the next moment the tenderness and the azureall would be shattered.         midtwentieth century ideas concerning childparent relationship have been considerably tainted by the scholastic rigmarole and standardized symbols of the psychoanalytic racket, but i hope i am addressing myself to unbiased readers. once when aviss father had honked outside to signal papa had come to take his pet home, i felt obliged to invite him into the parlor, and he sat down for a minute, and while we conversed, avis, a heavy, unattractive, affectionate child, drew up to him and eventually perched plumply on his knee. now, i do not remember if i have mentioned that lolita always had an absolutely enchanting smile for strangers, a tender furry slitting of the eyes, a dreamy sweet radiance of all her features which did not mean a thing of course, but was so beautiful, so endearing that one found it hard to reduce such sweetness to but a magic gene automatically lighting up her face in atavistic token of some ancient rite of welcomehospitable prostitution, the coarse reader may say. well, there she stood while mr. byrd twirled his hat and talked, andyes, look how stupid of me, i have left out the main characteristic of the famous lolita smile, namely while the tender, nectared, dimpled brightness played, it was never directed at the stranger in the room but hung in its own remote flowered void, so to speak, or wandered with myopic softness over chance objectsand this is what was happening now while fat avis sidled up to her papa, lolita gently beamed at a fruit knife that she fingered on the edge of the table, whereon she leaned, many miles away from me. suddenly, as avis clung to her fathers neck and ear while, with a casual arm, the man enveloped his lumpy and large offspring, i saw lolitas smile lose all its light and become a frozen little shadow of itself, and the fruit knife slipped off the table and struck her with its silver handle a freak blow on the ankle which made her gasp, and crouch head forward, and then, jumping on one leg, her face awful with the preparatory grimace which children hold till the tears gush, she was goneto be followed at once and consoled in the kitchen by avis who had such a wonderful fat pink dad and a small chubby brother, and a brandnew baby sister, and a home, and two grinning dogs, and lolita had nothing. and i have a neat pendant to that little scenealso in a beardsley setting. lolita, who had been reading near the fire, stretched herself, and then inquired, her elbow up, with a grunt where is she buried anyway who oh, you know, my murdered mummy. and          youknow where her grave is, i said controlling myself, whereupon i named the cemeteryjust outside ramsdale, between the railway tracks and lakeview hill. moreover, i added, the tragedy of such an accident is somewhat cheapened by the epithet you saw fit to apply to it. if you really wish to triumph in your mind over the idea of death ray, said lo for hurrah, and languidly left the room, and for a long while i stared with smarting eyes into the fire. then i picked up her book. it was some trash for young people. there was a gloomy girl marion, and there was her stepmother who turned out to be, against all expectations, a young, gay, understanding redhead who explained to marion that marions dead mother had really been a heroic woman since she had deliberately dissimulated her great love for marion because she was dying, and did not want her child to miss her. i did not rush up to her room with cries. i always preferred the mental hygiene of noninterference. now, squirming and pleading with my own memory, i recall that on this and similar occasions, it was always my habit and method to ignore lolitas states of mind while comforting my own base self. when my mother, in a livid wet dress, under the tumbling mist so i vividly imagined her, had run panting ecstatically up that ridge above moulinet to be felled there by a thunderbolt, i was but an infant, and in retrospect no yearnings of the accepted kind could i ever graft upon any moment of my youth, no matter how savagely psychotherapists heckled me in my later periods of depression. but i admit that a man of my power of imagination cannot plead personal ignorance of universal emotions. i may also have relied too much on the abnormally chill relations between charlotte and her daughter. but the awful point of the whole argument is this. it had become gradually clear to my conventional lolita during our singular and bestial cohabitation that even the most miserable of family lives was better than the parody of incest, which, in the long run, was the best i could offer the waif.                                             ramsdale revisited. i approached it from the side of the lake. the sunny noon was all eyes. as i rode by in my mudflecked car, i could distinguish scintillas of diamond water between the far pines. i turned into the cemetery and walked among the long and short stone monuments.          bonzhur, charlotte. on some of the graves there were pale, transparent little national flags slumped in the windless air under the evergreens. gee, ed, that was bad luckreferring to g. edward grammar, a thirtyfiveyearold new york office manager who had just been arrayed on a charge of murdering his thirtythreeyearold wife, dorothy. bidding for the perfect crime, ed had bludgeoned his wife and put her into a car. the case came to light when two county policemen on patrol saw mrs. grammars new big blue chrysler, an anniversary present from her husband, speeding crazily down a hill, just inside their jurisdiction god bless our good cops. the car sideswiped a pole, ran up an embankment covered with beard grass, wild strawberry and cinquefoil, and overturned. the wheels were still gently spinning in the mellow sunlight when the officers removed mrs. gs body. it appeared to be routine highway accident at first. alas, the womans battered body did not match up with only minor damage suffered by the car. i did better.         i rolled on. it was funny to see again the slender white church and the enormous elms. forgetting that in an american suburban street a lone pedestrian is more conspicuous than a lone motorist, i left the car in the avenue to walk unobtrusively past  lawn street. before the great bloodshed, i was entitled to a little relief, to a cathartic spasm of mental regurgitation. closed were the white shutters of the junk mansion, and somebody had attached a found black velvet hair ribbon to the white for sale sign which was leaning toward the sidewalk. no dog barked. no gardener telephoned. no miss opposite sat on the vined porchwhere to the lone pedestrians annoyance two ponytailed young women in identical polkadotted pinafores stopped doing whatever they were doing to stare at him she was long dead, no doubt, these might be her twin nieces from philadelphia.         should i enter my old house as in a turgenev story, a torrent of italian music came from an open windowthat of the living room what romantic soul was playing the piano where no piano had plunged and plashed on that bewitched sunday with the sun on her beloved legs all at once i noticed that from the lawn i had mown a goldenskinned, brownhaired nymphet of nine or ten, in white shorts, was looking at me with wild fascination in her large blueblack eyes. i said something pleasant to her, meaning no harm, an oldworld compliment, what nice eyes you have, but she retreated in haste and the music stopped abruptly, and a violentlooking dark man, glistening with sweat, came out and glared at me. i was on the point of identifying myself when, with a pang of dreamembarrassment, i became aware of my mudcaked dungarees, my filthy and torn sweater, my bristly chin, my bums bloodshot eyes. without saying a word, i turned and plodded back the way i had come. an asterlike anemic flower grew out of a remembered chink in the sidewalk. quietly resurrected, miss opposite was being wheeled out by her nieces, onto her porch, as if it were a stage and i the star performer. praying she would not call to me, i hurried to my car. what a steep little street. what a profound avenue. a red ticket showed between wiper and windshield i carefully tore it into two, four, eight pieces.         feeling i was losing my time, i drove energetically to the downtown hotel where i had arrived with a new bag more than five years before. i took a room, made two appointments by telephone, shaved, bathed, put on black clothes and went down for a drink in the bar. nothing had changed. the barroom was suffused with the same dim, impossible garnetred light that in europe years ago went with low haunts, but here meant a bit of atmosphere in a family hotel. i sat at the same little table where at the very start of my stay, immediately after becoming charlottes lodger, i had thought fit to celebrate the occasion by suavely sharing with her half a bottle of champagne, which had fatally conquered her poor brimming heart. as then, a moonfaced waiter was arranging with stellar care fifty sherries on a round tray for a wedding party. murphyfantasia, this time. it was eight minutes to three. as i walked though the lobby, i had to skirt a group of ladies who with          mille grceswere taking leave of each other after a luncheon party. with a harsh cry of recognition, one pounced upon me. she was a stout, short woman in pearlgray, with a long, gray, slim plume to her small hat. it was mrs. chatfield. she attacked me with a fake smile, all aglow with evil curiosity. had i done to dolly, perhaps, what frank lasalle, a fiftyyearold mechanic, had done o elevenyearold sally horner in  very soon i had that avid glee well under control she thought i was in california. how was with exquisite pleasure i informed her that my stepdaughter had just married a brilliant young mining engineer with a hushhush job in the northwest. she said she disapproved of such early marriages, she would never let her phillys, who was now eighteen         oh yes, of course, i said quietly. i remember phyllis. phyllis and camp q. yes, of course. by the way, did she ever tell you how charlie holmes debauched there his mothers little charges         mrs. chatfileds already broken smile now disintegrated completely.         for shame, she cried, for shame, mr. humbert the poor boy has just been killed in korea.         i said didnt she think           vient de,with the infinitive, expressed recent events so much more neatly than the english just, with the past but i had to be trotting off, i said.         there were only two blocks to windmullers office. he greeted me with a very slow, very enveloping, strong, searching grip. he thought i was in california. had i not lived at one time at beardsley his daughter had just entered beardsley college. and how was i have all necessary information about mrs. schiller. we had a pleasant business conference. i walked out into the hot september sunshine a contented pauper.         now that everything had been put out of the way, i could dedicate myself freely to the main object of my visit to ramsdale. in the methodical manner on which i have always prided myself, i had been keeping clare quiltys face masked in my dark dungeon, where he was waiting for me to come with barber and priest           rveillezvous, laqueue,il est temps de mourir i have no time right now to discuss the mnemonics of physiognomizationi am on my way to his uncle and walking fastbut let me jot down this i had preserved in the alcohol of a clouded memory the toad of a face. in the course of a few glimpses, i had noticed its slight resemblance to a cheery and rather repulsive wine dealer, a relative of mine in switzerland. with his dumbbells and stinking tricot, and fat hairy arms, and bald patch, and pigfaced servantconcubine, he was on the whole a harmless old rascal. too harmless, in fact, to be confused with my prey. in the state of mind i now found myself, i had lost contact with trapps image. it had become completely engulfed by the face of clare quiltyas represented, with artistic precision, by an easeled photograph of him that stood on his uncles desk.         in beardsley, at the hands of charming dr. molnar, i had undergone a rather serious dental operation, retaining only a few upper and lower front teeth. the substitutes were dependent on a system of plates with an inconspicuous wire affair running along my upper gums. the whole arrangement was a masterpiece of comfort, and my canines were in perfect health. however, to garnish my secret purpose with a plausible pretext, i told dr. quilty that, in hope of alleviating facial neuralgia, i had decided to have all my teeth removed. what would a complete set of dentures cost how long would the process take, assuming we fixed our first appointment for some time in november where was his famous nephew now would it be possible to have them all out in one dramatic session         a whitesmocked, grayhaired man, with a crew cut and the big flat cheeks of a politician, dr. quilty perched on the corner of his desk, one foot dreamily and seductively rocking as he launched on a glorious longrange plan. he would first provide me with provisional plates until the gums settled. then he would make me a permanent set. he would like to have a look at that mouth of mine. he wore perforated pied shoes. he had not visited with the rascal since , but supposed he could be found at his ancestral home, grimm road, not far from parkington. it was a noble dream. his foot rocked, his gaze was inspired. it would cost me around six hundred. he suggested he take measurements right away, and make the first set before starting operations. my mouth was to him a splendid cave full of priceless treasures, but i denied him entrance.         no, i said. on second thoughts, i shall have it all done by dr. molnar. his price is higher, but he is of course a much better dentist than you.         i do not know if any of my readers will ever have a chance to say that. it is a delicious dream feeling. clares uncle remained sitting on the desk, still looking dreamy, but his foot had stopped pushrocking the cradle of rosy anticipation. on the other hand, his nurse, a skeletonthin, faded girl, with the tragic eyes of unsuccessful blondes, rushed after me so as to be able to slam the door in my wake.         push the magazine into the butt. press home until you hear or feel the magazine catch engage. delightfully snug. capacity eight cartridges. full blued. aching to be discharged.                                             a gas station attendant in parkington explained to me very clearly how to get to grimm road. wishing to be sure quilty would be at home, i attempted to ring him up but learned that his private telephone had recently been disconnected. did that mean he was gone i started to drive to grimm road, twelve miles north of the town. by that time night had eliminated most of the landscape and as i followed the narrow winding highway, a series of short posts, ghostly white, with reflectors, borrowed my own lights to indicate this or that curve. i could make out a dark valley on one side of the road and wooded slopes on the other, and in front of me, like derelict snowflakes, moths drifted out of the blackness into my probing aura. at the twelfth mile, as foretold, a curiously hooded bridge sheathed me for a moment and, beyond it, a whitewashed rock loomed on the right, and a few car lengths further, on the same side, i turned off the highway up gravelly grimm road. for a couple of minutes all was dank, dark, dense forest. then, pavor manor, a wooden house with a turret, arose in a circular clearing. its windows glowed yellow and red its drive was cluttered with half a dozen cars. i stopped in the shelter of the trees and abolished my lights to ponder the next move quietly. he would be surrounded by his henchmen and whores. i could not help seeing the inside of that festive and ramshackle castle in terms of troubled teens, a story in one of her magazines, vague orgies, a sinister adult with penele cigar, drugs, bodyguards. at least, he was there. i would return in the torpid morning.         gently i rolled back to town, in that old faithful car of mine which was serenely, almost cheerfully working for me. my lolita there was still a threeyearold bobby pin of hers in the depths of the glove compartment. there was still that stream of pale moths siphoned out of the night by my headlights. dark barns still propped themselves up here and there by the roadside. people were still going to the movies. while searching for night lodgings, i passed a drivein. in a selenian glow, truly mystical in its contrast with the moonless and massive night, on a gigantic screen slanting away among dark drowsy fields, a thin phantom raised a gun, both he and his arm reduced to tremulous dishwater by the oblique angle of that receding world,and the next moment a row of trees shut off the gesticulation.                                             i left insomnia lodge next morning around eight and spent some time in parkington. visions of bungling the execution kept obsessing me. thinking that perhaps the cartridges in the automatic had gone stale during a week of inactivity, i removed them and inserted a fresh batch. such a thorough oil bath did i give chum that now i could not get rid of the stuff. i bandaged him up with a rag, like a maimed limb, and used another rag to wrap up a handful of spare bullets.         a thunderstorm accompanied me most of the way back to grimm road, but when i reached pavor manor, the sun was visible again, burning like a man, and the birds screamed in the drenched and steaming trees. the elaborate and decrepit house seemed to stand in a kind of daze, reflecting as it were my own state, for i could not help realizing, as my feet touched the springy and insecure ground, that i had overdone the alcoholic stimulation business.         a guardedly ironic silence answered my bell. the garage, however, was loaded with his car, a black convertible for the nonce. i tried the knocker. renobody. with a petulant snarl, i pushed the front doorand, how nice, it swung open as in a medieval fairy tale. having softly closed it behind me, i made my way across a spacious and very ugly hall peered into an adjacent drawing room noticed a number of used glasses growing out of the carpet decided that master was still asleep in the master bedroom.         so i trudged upstairs. my right hand clutched muffled chum in my pocket, my left patted the sticky banisters. of the three bedrooms i inspected, one had obviously been slept in that night. there was a library full of flowers. there was a rather bare room with ample and deep mirrors and a polar bear skin on the slippery floor. there were still other rooms. a happy though struck me. if and when master returned from his constitutional in the woods, or emerged from some secret lair, it might be wise for an unsteady gunman with a long job before him to prevent his playmate from locking himself up in a room. consequently, for at least five minutes i went aboutlucidly insane, crazily calm, an enchanted and very tight hunterturning whatever keys in whatever locks there were and pocketing more planned privacy than have modern glamourboxes, where the bathroom, the only lockable locus, has to be used for the furtive needs of planned parenthood.         speaking of bathroomsi was about to visit a third one when master came out of it, leaving a brief waterfall behind him. the corner of a passage did not quite conceal me. grayfaced, baggyeyed, fluffily disheveled in a scanty balding way, but still perfectly recognizable, he swept by me in a purple bathrobe, very like one i had. he either did not notice me, or else dismissed me as some familiar and innocuous hallucinationand, showing me his hairy calves, he proceeded, sleepwalkerwise, downstairs. i pocketed my last key and followed him into the entrance hall. he had half opened his mouth and the front door, to peer out through a sunny chink as one who thinks he has heard a halfhearted visitor ring and recede. then, still ignoring the raincoated phantasm that had stopped in midstairs, master walked into a cozy boudoir across the hall from the drawing room, through whichtaking it easy, knowing he was safei now went away from him, and in a baradorned kitchen gingerly unwrapped dirty chum, talking care not to leave any oil stains on the chromei think i got the wrong product, it was black and awfully messy. in my usual meticulous way, i transferred naked chum to a clean recess about me and made for the little boudoir. my step, as i say, was springytoo springy perhaps for success. but my heart pounded with tiger joy, and i crunched a cocktail glass underfoot.         master met me in the oriental parlor.         now who are you he asked in a high hoarse voice, his hands thrust into his dressinggown pockets, his eyes fixing a point to the northeast of my head. are you by any chance brewster         by now it was evident to everybody that he was in a fog and completely at my socalled mercy. i could enjoy myself.         thats right, i answered suavely.           je         suis         monsieur brustre.let us chat for a moment before we start.         he looked pleased. his smudgy mustache twitched. i removed my raincoat. i was wearing a black suit, a black shirt, no tie. we sat down in two easy chairs.         you know, he said, scratching loudly his fleshy and gritty gray cheek and showing his small pearly teeth in a crooked grin, you dont          looklike jack brewster. i mean, the resemblance is not particularly striking. somebody told me he had a brother with the same telephone company.         to have him trapped, after those years of repentance and rage to look at the black hairs on the back of his pudgy hands to wander with a hundred eyes over his purple silks and hirsute chest foreglimpsing the punctures, and mess, and music of pain to know that this semianimated, subhuman trickster who had sodomized my darlingoh, my darling, this was intolerable bliss         no, i am afraid i am neither of the brewsters.         he cocked his head, looking more pleased than ever.         guess again, punch.         ah, said punch, so you have not come to bother me about those longdistance calls         you do make them once in a while, dont you         excuse me         i said i had said i thought he had said he had never         people, he said, people in general, im not accusing you, brewster, but you know its absurd the way people invade this damned house without even knocking. they use the          vaterre, they use the kitchen, they use the telephone. phil calls philadelphia. pat calls patagonia. i refuse to pay. you have a funny accent, captain.         quilty, i said, do you recall a little girl called dolores haze, dolly haze dolly called dolores, colo.         sure, she may have made those calls, sure. any place. paradise, wash., hell canyon. who cares         i do, quilty. you see, i am her father.         nonsense, he said. you are not. you are some foreign literary agent. a frenchman once translated my          proud fleshas          la fiert de la chair. absurd.         she was my child, quilty.         in the state he was in he could not really be taken aback by anything, but his blustering manner was not quite convincing. a sort of wary inkling kindled his eyes into a semblance of life. they were immediately dulled again.         im very fond of children myself, he said, and fathers are among my best friends.         he turned his head away, looking for something. he beat his pockets. he attempted to rise from his seat.         down i saidapparently much louder than i intended.         you need not roar at me, he complained in his strange feminine manner. i just wanted a smoke. im dying for a smoke.         youre dying anyway.         oh, chucks, he said. you begin to bore me. what do you want are you french, mister woolywoobooare lets go to the barroomette and have a stiff         he saw the little dark weapon lying in my palm as if i were offering it to him.         say he drawled now imitating the underworld numskull of movies, thats a swell little gun youve got there. what dyou want for her         i slapped down his outstretched hand and he managed to knock over a box on a low table near him. it ejected a handful of cigarettes.         here they are, he said cheerfully. you recall kipling          une femme         est         une femme, mais un caporal est une cigarettenow we need matches.         quilty, i said. i want you to concentrate. you are going to die in a moment. the hereafter for all we know may be an eternal state of excruciating insanity. you smoked your last cigarette yesterday. concentrate. try to understand what is happening to you.         he kept taking the drome cigarette apart and munching bits of it.         i am willing to try, he said. you are either australian, or a german refugee. must you talk to me this is a gentiles house, you know. maybe, youd better run along. and do stop demonstrating that gun. ive an old sternluger in the music room.         i pointed chum at his slippered foot and crushed the trigger. it clicked. he looked at his foot, at the pistol, again at his foot. i made another awful effort, and, with a ridiculously feeble and juvenile sound, it went off. the bullet entered the thick pink rug, and i had the paralyzing impression that it had merely trickled in and might come out again.         see what i mean said quilty. you should be a little more careful. give me that thing for christs sake.         he reached for it. i pushed him back into the chair. the rich joy was waning. it was high time i destroyed him, but he must understand why he was being destroyed. his condition infected me, the weapon felt limp and clumsy in my hand.         concentrate, i said, on the thought of dolly haze whom you kidnapped         i did not he cried. youre all wet. i saved her from a beastly pervert. show me your badge instead of shooting at my foot, you ape, you. where is that badge im not responsible for the rapes of others. absurd that joy ride, i grant you, was a silly stunt but you got her back, didnt you come, lets have a drink.         i asked him whether he wanted to be executed sitting or standing.         ah, let me think, he said. it is not an easy question. incidentallyi made a mistake. which i sincerely regret. you see, i had no fun with your dolly. i am practically impotent, to tell the melancholy truth. and i gave her a splendid vacation. she met some remarkable people. do you happen to know         and with a tremendous lurch he fell all over me, sending the pistol hurtling under a chest of drawers. fortunately he was more impetuous than vigorous, and i had little difficulty in shoving him back into his chair.         he puffed a little and folded his arms on his chest.         now youve done it, he said.           vous voil dans de beaux draps, mon vieux.         his french was improving.         i looked around. perhaps, ifperhaps i couldon my hands and knees risk it                   alors, que faitonhe asked watching me closely.         i stooped. he did not moved. i stooped lower.         my dear sir, he said, stop trifling with life and death. i am a playwright. i have written tragedies, comedies, fantasies. i have made private movies out of          justineand other eighteenthcentury sexcapades. im the author of fiftytwo successful scenarios. i know all the ropes. let me handle this. there should be a poker somewhere, why dont i fetch it, and then well fish out your property.         fussily, busybodily, cunningly, he had risen again while he talked. i groped under the chest trying at the same time to keep an eye on him. all of a sudden i noticed that he had noticed that i did not seem to have noticed chum protruding from beneath the other corner of the chest. we fell to wrestling again. we rolled all over the floor, in each others arms, like two huge helpless children. he was naked and goatish under his robe, and i felt suffocated as he rolled over me. i rolled over him. we rolled over me. they rolled over him. we rolled over us.         in its published form, this book is being read, i assume, in the first years of  a.d.  plus eighty or ninety, live long, my love and elderly readers will surely recall at this point the obligatory scene in the westerns of their childhood. our tussle, however, lacked the oxstunning fisticuffs, the flying furniture. he and i were two large dummies, stuffed with dirty cotton and rags. it was a silent, soft, formless tussle on the part of two literati, one of whom was utterly disorganized by a drug while the other was handicapped by a heart condition and too much gin. when at last i had possessed myself of my precious weapon, and the scenario writer had been reinstalled in his low chair, both of us were panting as the cowman and the sheepman never do after their battle.         i decided to inspect the pistolour sweat might have spoiled somethingand regain my wind before proceeding to the main item in the program. to fill in the pause, i proposed he read his own sentencein the poetical form i had given it. the term poetical justice is one that may be most happily used in this respect. i handed him a neat typescript.         yes, he said, splendid idea. let me fetch my reading glasses he attempted to rise.         no.         just as you say. shall i read out loud         yes.         here goes. i see its in verse.                                 because you took advantage of a sinner             because you took advantage             because you took             because you took advantage of my disadvantage                             thats good, you know. thats damned good.                                 when i stood adamnaked             before a federal law and all its stinging stars                             oh, grand stuff                                 because you took advantage of a sin             when i was helpless moulting moist and tender             hoping for the best             dreaming of marriage in a mountain state             aye of a litter of lolitas                             didnt get that.                                 because you took advantage of my inner             essential innocence             because you cheated me                             a little repetitious, what where was i                                 because you cheated me of my redemption             because you took             her at the age when lads             play with erector sets                             getting smutty, eh                                 a little downy girl still wearing poppies             still eating popcorn in the colored gloam             where tawny indians took paid croppers             because you stole her             from her waxbrowed and dignified protector             spitting into his heavylidded eye             ripping his flavid toga and at dawn             leaving the hog to roll upon his new discomfort             the awfulness of love and violets             remorse despair while you             took a dull doll to pieces             and threw its head away             because of all you did             because of all i did not             you have to die                             well, sir, this is certainly a fine poem. your best as far as im concerned.         he folded and handed it back to me.         i asked him if he had anything serious to say before dying. the automatic was again ready for use on the person. he looked at it and heaved a big sigh.         now look here, mac, he said. you are drunk and i am a sick man. let us postpone the matter. i need quiet. i have to nurse my impotence. friends are coming in the afternoon to take me to a game. this pistolpacking face is becoming a frightful nuisance. we are men of the world, in everythingsex, free verse, marksmanship. if you bear me a grudge, i am ready to make unusual amends. even an oldfashioned          rencontre, sword or pistol, in rio or elsewhereis not excluded. my memory and my eloquence are not at their best today, but really, my dear mr. humbert, you were not an ideal stepfather, and i did not force your little protg to join me. it was she made me remove her to a happier home. this house is not as modern as that ranch we shared with dear friends. but it is roomy, cool in summer and winter, and in a word comfortable, so, since i intend retiring to england or florence forever, i suggest you move in. it is yours, gratis. under the condition you stop pointing at me that he swore disgustingly gun. by the way, i do not know if you care for the bizarre, but if you do, i can offer you, also gratis, as house pet, a rather exciting little freak, a young lady with three breasts, one a dandy, this is a rare and delightful marvel of nature. now,          soyons raisonnables. you will only wound me hideously and then rot in jail while i recuperate in a tropical setting. i promise you, brewster, you will be happy here, with a magnificent cellar, and all the royalties from my next playi have not much at the bank right now but i propose to borrowyou know, as the bard said, with that cold in his head, to borrow and to borrow and to borrow. there are

two i know about the chief of police makes him my slave. i am a playwright. i have been called the american maeterlinck. maeterlinckschmetterling, says i. come on all this is very humiliating, and i am not sure i am doing the right thing. never use herculanita with rum. now drop that pistol like a good fellow. i knew your dear wife slightly. you may use my wardrobe. oh, another thingyou are going to like this. i have an absolutely unique collection of erotica upstairs. just to mention one item the in folio deluxe          bagration islandby the explorer and psychoanalyst melanie weiss, a remarkable lady, a remarkable workdrop that gunwith photographs of eight hundred and something male organs she examined and measured in  on bagration, in the barda sea, very illuminating graphs, plotted with love under pleasant skiesdrop that gunand moreover i can arrange for you to attend executions, not everybody knows that the chair is painted yellow                  feu. this time i hit something hard. i hit the back of a black rocking chair, not unlike dolly schillersmy bullet hit the inside surface of its back whereupon it immediately went into a rocking act, so fast and with such zest that any one coming into the room might have been flabbergasted by the double miracle that chair rocking in a panic all by itself, and the armchair, where my purple target had just been, now void of all life content. wiggling his fingers in the air, with a rapid heave of his rump, he flashed into the music room and the next second we were tugging and gasping on both sides of the door which had a key i had overlooked. i won again, and with another abrupt movement clare the impredictable sat down before the piano and played several atrociously vigorous, fundamentally hysterical, plangent chords, his jowls quivering, his spread hands tensely plunging, and his nostrils emitting the soundtrack snorts which had been absent from our fight. still singing those impossible sonorities, he made a futile attempt to open with his foot a kind of seamans chest near the piano. my next bullet caught him somewhere in the side, and he rose from his chair higher and higher, like old, gray, mad nijinski, like old faithful, like some old nightmare of mine, to a phenomenal altitude, or so it seemed, as he rent the airstill shaking with the rich black musichead thrown back in a howl, hand pressed to his brow, and with his other hand clutching his armpit as if stung by a hornet, down he came on his heels and, again a normal robed man, scurried out into the hall.         i see myself following him through the hall, with a kind of double, triple, kangaroo jump, remaining quite straight on straight legs while bouncing up twice in his wake, and then bouncing between him and the front door in a balletlike stiff bounce, with the purpose of heading him off, since the door was not properly closed.         suddenly dignified, and somewhat morose, he started to walk up the broad stairs, and, shifting my position, but not actually following him up the steps, i fired three or four times in quick succession, wounding him at every blaze and every time i did it to him, that horrible thing to him, his face would twitch in an absurd clownish manner, as if he were exaggerating the pain he slowed down, rolled his eyes half closing them and made a feminine ah and he shivered every time a bullet hit him as if i were tickling him, and every time i got him with those slow, clumsy, blind bullets of mine, he would say under his breath, with a phony british accentall the while dreadfully twitching, shivering, smirking, but withal talking in a curiously detached and even amiable manner ah, that hurts, sir, enough ah, that hurts atrociously, my dear fellow. i pray you, desist. ahvery painful, very painful, indeed god hah this is abominable, you should really not his voice trailed off as he reached the landing, but he steadily walked on despite all the lead i had lodged in his bloated bodyand in distress, in dismay, i understood that far from killing him i was injecting spurts of energy into the poor fellow, as if the bullets had been capsules wherein a heady elixir danced.         i reloaded the thing with hands that were black and bloodyi had touched something he had anointed with his thick gore. then i rejoined him upstairs, the keys jangling in my pockets like gold.         he was trudging from room to room, bleeding majestically, trying to find an open window, shaking his head, and still trying to talk me out of murder. i took aim at his head, and he retired to the master bedroom with a burst of royal purple where his ear had been.         get out, get out of here, he said coughing and spitting and in a nightmare of wonder, i saw this bloodspattered but still buoyant person get into his bed and wrap himself up in the chaotic bedclothes. i hit him at very close range through the blankets, and then he lay back, and a big pink bubble with juvenile connotations formed on his lips, grew to the size of a toy balloon, and vanished.         i may have lost contact with reality for a second or twooh, nothing of the ijustblackedout sort that your common criminal enacts on the contrary, i want to stress the fact that i was responsible for every shed drop of his bubbleblood but a kind of momentary shift occurred as if i were in the connubial bedroom, and charlotte were sick in bed. quilty was a very sick man. i held one of his slippers instead of the pistoli was sitting on the pistol. then i made myself a little more comfortable in the chair near the bed, and consulted my wrist watch. the crystal was gone but it ticked. the whole sad business had taken more than an hour. he was quiet at last. far from feeling any relief, a burden even weightier than the one i had hoped to get rid of was with me, upon me, over me. i could not bring myself to touch him in order to make sure he was really dead. he looked it a quarter of his face gone, and two flies beside themselves with a dawning sense of unbelievable luck. my hands were hardly in better condition than his. i washed up as best i could in the adjacent bathroom. now i could leave. as i emerged on the landing, i was amazed to discover that a vivacious buzz i had just been dismissing as a mere singing in my ears was really a medley of voices and radio music coming from the downstairs drawing room.         i found there a number of people who apparently had just arrived and were cheerfully drinking quiltys liquor. there was a fat man in an easy chair and two darkhaired pale young beauties, sisters no doubt, big one and small one almost a child, demurely sat side by side on a davenport. a floridfaced fellow with sapphireblue eyes was in the act of bringing two glasses out of the barlike kitchen, where two or three women were chatting and chinking ice. i stopped in the doorway and said i have just killed clare quilty. good for you, said the florid fellow as he offered one of the drinks to the elder girl. somebody ought to have done it long ago, remarked the fat man. what does he say, tony asked a faded blonde from the bar. he says, answered the florid fellow, he has killed cue. well, said another unidentified man rising in a corner where he had been crouching to inspect some records, i guess we all should do it to him some day. anyway, said tony, hed better come down. we cant wait for him much longer if we want to go to that game. give this man a drink somebody, said the fat person. what a beer said a woman in slacks, showing it to me from afar.         only the two girls on the davenport, both wearing black, the younger fingering a bright something about her white neck, only they said nothing, but just smiled on, so young, so lewd. as the music paused for a moment, there was a sudden noise on the stairs. tony and i stepped out into the hall. quilty of all people had managed to crawl out onto the landing, and there we could see him, flapping and heaving, and then subsiding, forever this time, in a purple heap.         hurry up, cue, said tony with a laugh. i believe, hes still he returned to the drawing room, music drowned the rest of the sentence.         this, i said to myself, was the end of the ingenious play staged for me by quilty. with a heavy heart i left the house and walked though the spotted blaze of the sun to my car. two other cars were parked on both sides of it, and i had some trouble squeezing out.                                             the rest is a little flattish and faded. slowly i drove downhill, and presently found myself going at the same lazy pace in a direction opposite to parkington. i had left my raincoat in the boudoir and chum in the bathroom. no, it was not a house i would have liked to live in. i wondered idly if some surgeon of genius might not alter his own career, and perhaps the whole destiny of mankind, by reviving quilted quilty, clare obscure. not that i cared on the whole i wished to forget the whole messand when i did learn he was dead, the only satisfaction it gave me, was the relief of knowing i need not mentally accompany for months a painful and disgusting convalescence interrupted by all kinds of unmentionable operations and relapses, and perhaps an actual visit from him, with trouble on my part to rationalize him as not being a ghost. thomas had something. it is strange that the tactile sense, which is so infinitely less precious to men than sight, becomes at critical moment our main, if not only, handle to reality. i was all covered with quiltywith the feel of that tumble before the bleeding.         the road now stretched across open country, and it occurred to menot by way of protest, not as a symbol, or anything like that, but merely as a novel experiencethat since i had disregarded all laws of humanity, i might as well disregard the rules of traffic. so i crossed to the left side of the highway and checked the feeling, and the feeling was good. it was a pleasant diaphragmal melting, with elements of diffused tactility, all this enhanced by the thought that nothing could be nearer to the elimination of basic physical laws than deliberately driving on the wrong side of the road. in a way, it was a very spiritual itch. gently, dreamily, not exceeding twenty miles an hour, i drove on that queer mirror side. traffic was light. cars that now and then passed me on the side i had abandoned to them, honked at me brutally. cars coming towards me wobbled, swerved, and cried out in fear. presently i found myself approaching populated places. passing through a red light was like a sip of forbidden burgundy when i was a child. meanwhile complications were arising. i was being followed and escorted. then in front of me i saw two cars placing themselves in such a manner as to completely block my way. with a graceful movement i turned off the road, and after two or three big bounces, rode up a grassy slope, among surprised cows, and there i came to a gentle rocking stop. a kind of thoughtful hegelian synthesis linking up two dead women.         i was soon to be taken out of the car hi, melmoth, thanks a lot, old fellowand was, indeed, looking forward to surrender myself to many hands, without doing anything to cooperate, while they moved and carried me, relaxed, comfortable, surrendering myself lazily, like a patient, and deriving an eerie enjoyment from my limpness and the absolutely reliable support given me by the police and the ambulance people. and while i was waiting for them to run up to me on the high slope, i evoked a last mirage of wonder and hopelessness. one day, soon after her disappearance, an attack of abominable nausea forced me to pull up on the ghost of an old mountain road that now accompanied, now traversed a brand new highway, with its population of asters bathing in the detached warmth of a paleblue afternoon in late summer. after coughing myself inside out, i rested a while on a boulder, and then, thinking the sweet air might do me good, walked a little way toward a low stone parapet on the precipice side of the highway. small grasshoppers spurted out of the withered roadside weeds. a very light cloud was opening its arms and moving toward a slightly more substantial one belonging to another, more sluggish, heavenlogged system. as i approached the friendly abyss, i grew aware of a melodious unity of sounds rising like vapor from a small mining town that lay at my feet, in a fold of the valley. one could make out the geometry of the streets between blocks of red and gray roofs, and green puffs of trees, and a serpentine stream, and the rich, orelike glitter of the city dump, and beyond the town, roads crisscrossing the crazy quilt of dark and pale fields, and behind it all, great timbered mountains. but even brighter than those quietly rejoicing colorsfor there are colors and shades that seem to enjoy themselves in good companyboth brighter and dreamier to the ear than they were to the eye, was that vapory vibration of accumulated sounds that never ceased for a moment, as it rose to the lip of granite where i stood wiping my foul mouth. and soon i realized that all these sounds were of one nature, that no other sounds but these came from the streets of the transparent town, with the women at home and the men away. reader what i heard was but the melody of children at play, nothing but that, and so limpid was the air that within this vapor of blended voices, majestic and minute, remote and magically near, frank and divinely enigmaticone could hear now and then, as if released, an almost articulate spurt of vivid laughter, or the crack of a bat, or the clatter of a toy wagon, but it was all really too far for the eye to distinguish any movement in the lightly etched streets. i stood listening to that musical vibration from my lofty slope, to those flashes of separate cries with a kind of demure murmur for background, and then i knew that the hopelessly poignant thing was not lolitas absence from my side, but the absence of her voice from that concord.         this then is my story. i have reread it. it has bits of marrow sticking to it, and blood, and beautiful brightgreen flies. at this or that twist of it i feel my slippery self eluding me, gliding into deeper and darker waters than i care to probe. i have camouflaged what i could so as not to hurt people. and i have toyed with many pseudonyms for myself before i hit on a particularly apt one. there are in my notes otto otto and mesmer mesmer and lambert lambert, but for some reason i think my choice expresses the nastiness best.         when i started, fiftysix days ago, to write          lolita, first in the psychopathic ward for observation, and then in this wellheated, albeit tombal, seclusion, i thought i would use these notes in toto at my trial, to save not my head, of course, but my soul. in mindcomposition, however, i realized that i could not parade living lolita. i still may use parts of this memoir in hermetic sessions, but publication is to be deferred.         for reasons that may appear more obvious than they really are, i am opposed to capital punishment this attitude will be, i trust, shared by the sentencing judge. had i come before myself, i would have given humbert at least thirtyfive years for rape, and dismissed the rest of the charges. but even so, dolly schiller will probably survive me by many years. the following decision i make with all the legal impact and support of a signed testament i wish this memoir to be published only when lolita is no longer alive.         thus, neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book. but while the blood still throbs through my writing hand, you are still as much part of blessed matter as i am, and i can still talk to you from here to alaska. be true to your dick. do not let other fellows touch you. do not talk to strangers. i hope you will love your baby. i hope it will be a boy. that husband of yours, i hope, will always treat you well, because otherwise my specter shall come at him, like black smoke, like a demented giant, and pull him apart nerve by nerve. and do not pity c. q. one had to choose between him and h.h., and one wanted h.h. to exist at least a couple of months longer, so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations. i am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. and this is the only immortality you and i may share, my lolita.'"
